# About

Hi! My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I'm a software engineer, and a
systems administrator. My CV can be found [here](/cv/cv-en.pdf).

When I need to percolate, I take of places, people, and things, and
put them to my [deviantART](http://ebzzry.deviantart.com) gallery. I
love to play 2D Fighting (USF4), FPS (Xonotic), and RPG (Chrono
Trigger) games.

I am turtling my way into publishing my stuff to my
[GitHub](http://www.github.com) account. I primarily use
[Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org) for writing code, and I use
[NixOS](http://nixos.org) as my primary system.

You can find me on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/rmm.meta.ph), and on
[Twitter](http://twiter.com/ebzzry). You may drop me a note at
`rmm@meta.ph`.
