# About

Hi! My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I'm a software engineer, and a
systems administrator. My CV can be found
[here](http://rmm.meta.ph/cv/cv-en.pdf).

I live an [active](http://facebook.com/teamalphatier) lifestyle. I
exercise daily, with programs including, but not limited to:
kettlebell, rings, martial arts, bodyweight, and ashtanga yoga.

When I need to percolate, I take
[pictures](http://ebzzry.deviantart.com) of places, people, and
objects. I love to play FPS, 2D fighting, and 8- and 16-bit games.

I am slowly working my way into publishing my trivial works to my
[GitHub](http://github.com/ebzzry) account. I am currently working on
projects, using [NixOS](http://nixos.org) and
[Racket](http://racket-lang.org).
