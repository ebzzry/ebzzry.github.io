# About

Hi! My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I'm a software engineer, and a
systems administrator. My CV can be found [here](/cv/cv-en.pdf).

I am turtling my way into publishing my stuff to my
[GitHub](http://github.com) account. I primarily use
[Racket](http://racket-lang.org), [OCaml](http://ocaml.org), and I use
[NixOS](http://nixos.org), and [Debian](http://debian.org) as my
primary systems.

When I need to percolate, I take of places, people, and things, and
put them to my [deviantART](http://ebzzry.deviantart.com) gallery. I
love to play 2D Fighting (USF4), FPS (Xonotic), and RPG (Chrono
Trigger) games.

You may drop me a note at `rmm@meta.ph`.
