# About

My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I am a software engineer, and systems
administrator. My interests are progamming language theory,
automation, algorithms, and philosophy.

I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) as my main system, with a
[Debian](http://debian.org) chroot. I write most of my programs in
[Clojure](http://clojure.org), and [Racket](http://racket-lang.org),
and occasionally, [OCaml](http://ocaml.org). I share what I write, on
my [GitHub](http://github.com/ebzzry) account. From time to time, I
post photographs on my [DeviantArt](https://ebzzry.deviantart.com/)
page.

You may contact me at <ebzzry@gmail.com>.
