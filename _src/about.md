# About

Hi! My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I'm mostly software a engineer, and
a systems administrator. My interests are compiler design, automation,
algorithms, programming languages, and psychology.

I use [NixOS](http://nixos.org) as my main system. I write most of my
programs in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), and
[OCaml](http://ocaml.org). I'm recently picking up
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). I have a
[GitHub](http://github.com/ebzzry) account.

I take pictures of places, people, and things, and put them to my
[gallery](http://ebzzry.deviantart.com). I also happen to love
fighting, and FPS games.

You may contact me at `ebzzry@gmail.com`.
