# About

Hi! My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I'm a software engineer, and a
systems administrator.My CV can be found [here](/cv/cv-en.pdf).

I use [NixOS](http://nixos.org) as my main system, and I write most of
my programs now in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), and
[OCaml](http://ocaml.org). I have a [GitHub](http://github.com/ebzzry)
account.

When I need to percolate, I take of places, people, and things, and
put them to my [DA](http://ebzzry.deviantart.com) gallery. I also
happen to love fighting, and fps games.

My favicon was taken from the seminal work of my brother
[Reynante](http://reynantemartinez.com) entitled
[Distant Worlds](http://www.reynantemartinez.com/distant-worlds.html).

You may contact me at `rmm@meta.ph`.
