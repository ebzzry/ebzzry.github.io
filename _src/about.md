# About

Hi! My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I'm a software engineer, and a
systems administrator.

I use [NixOS](http://nixos.org) as my main system. I write most of my
programs in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), and
[OCaml](http://ocaml.org). I'm recently picking up
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). I have a
[GitHub](http://github.com/ebzzry) account.

When I need to percolate, I take pictures of places, people, and
things, and put them to my [DA](http://ebzzry.deviantart.com)
gallery. I also happen to love fighting, and FPS games.

My favicon was taken from the seminal work of my brother
[Reynante](http://reynantemartinez.com) entitled
[Distant Worlds](http://www.reynantemartinez.com/distant-worlds.html).

You may contact me at `ebzzry@gmail.com`.
