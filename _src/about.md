# About

Hi! My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I'm mostly software a engineer, and
a systems administrator. My interests are compiler design, automation,
algorithms, programming languages, and psychology.

I use [NixOS](http://nixos.org) as my main system. I write most of my
programs in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), and
[OCaml](http://ocaml.org). I'm recently picking up
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). I have a
[GitHub](http://github.com/ebzzry) account.

You may contact me at `(rot13 (reverse "lemmor"))@gmail.com`.
