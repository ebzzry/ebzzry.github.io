I am pleased to announce the release of @bold{Usync}, a site-to-site
synchronization tool written in @hyperlink["http://www.scsh.net" "Scsh"]. It
makes use of @hyperlink["http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/" "Unison"],
and @hyperlink["http://rsync.samba.org/" "rsync"], for bi- and uni-directional
synchronizations, respectively.

The sources, along with additional information, are located at
@hyperlink["http://github.com/ebzzry/usync" "http://github.com/ebzzry/usync"].
