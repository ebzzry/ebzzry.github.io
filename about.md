About
======================================================================

My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I am a software engineer, and systems
administrator. My interests lie roughly in PLT, automation,
and algorithms.

I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org), with a [Debian](https://debian.org)
chroot as my main system. I write most of my programs in
[Clojure](https://clojure.org), and
[Racket](https://racket-lang.org). I share my code at
<https://github.com/ebzzry>. From time to time, I post pictures on
<https://ebzzry.deviantart.com>.

You may contact me at <ebzzry@gmail.com>.
