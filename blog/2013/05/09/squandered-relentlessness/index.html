 <p>There is a disturbing, and eerie sensation that I feel whenever the
damping realization that I am no longer a young child, is observed in
my consciousness. The uneasy struggle between learning to let go of my
portentous past and my capricious future, grips me, with heavy
clench. It is not about the inability to redo gratuitous expenditure
of somewhat liberally-provided lax confinements of time, but it is
about the unsettling observation that the mindset I previously took
for granted, is now something that would require me Atlas strength to
even begin to summon. I miss the unrelenting inquisitiveness that I
once wielded with ease, to my daily scuffling scores with the hordes
of raids of life.</p>


 <p>When we move past our zones of comfort, we are filled with eagerness
to return back to our own fortified bunkers. We see our own phantasmal
doppelgangers, communicating and showing to us what impending
atrocities may rise out of the ground, ready to devour us alive. The
longer we stay outside, the higher the probability of death. We make
ourselves believe our own convictions. We justify through our own
uncalibrated scales of what choices to make. Whenever unfamiliar
territory is explored, we almost instantly coil ourselves, back, into
seemingly intractable forms. We do it because of fear. We do it
because we do not like the unfamiliar. We do it because of our
affinity and devotion to safety.</p>


 <p>We complain of the stifling absence of bounty, and yet we voluntarily
stop ourselves from making even an inch of movement of a limb towards
making the advancement on a prey. We are so romantically in love, with
fervor, on the seeking of rationale to our unjustifiable excuses, but
we equally seek sound reason. It is even more appalling to see that
some of us insidiously advertise illusions of grandeur, with claims of
full reprising sensations of the bounty&rsquo;s meat. Our personal biases
towards reaching the reward, effectively stops us from actually
reaching it. We succumb to the remorseless claims of others, on their
failure, effectively rendering us ignorant of the unseen reality. When
the number of persons that flock around us, is high enough, according
to our personal metrics, we ignorantly instill to ourselves what they
buzz to us, and then we impair ourselves and subsequently kill the
essence of our individuality.</p>


 <p>As adults, we are taught to restrain ourselves inside cages that we
ourselves have built. It is unnerving to see this monstrous act unfold
before my short field of view, everyday. We drag ourselves towards
solitary confinements of our own barbed rooms. We make ourselves fond
of preaching doubt to our fellowmen. And if our own kind does the
same, we see feelings of accomplishment. That is not only horrendous,
but also unsurprisingly stupid. When we were still young, we reach out
to empty space, and create our own discoveries. We find out about
things previously untaught to us. We have the willful disregard for
danger and authority. We do not care how about the scratches and
bruises that we get, as long as we satisfy our wild and insatiable
taste for discovery. When fueled by curiosity, we discover yet another
realm of possibilities &ndash; we find ourselves immersed in dimensions
never before heard or seen, and no matter how much dirt and mud we
lather up to our bodies, we did not care. All that mattered to us was
to have fun in walking the unending journey of discovery. And yet, we
learned.</p>


 <p>It is ironic that just when we think we are already old enough to
venture the world unaided by our training wheels, we smother ourselves
with mediocre goals of pseudo-discovery. When the curtain is unveiled,
we are confronted by an unsettling sight &ndash; we have lost the drive
that once propelled us to have insights. We grew afraid to exercise
the same techniques and principles we had once as children. We stopped
ourselves from making curious inquisitions about what&rsquo;s out there. We
have made ourselves feel comfortable with what is served on the
institutionalized plates, without the slightest attempt to bolster up
to devise questions. The society, which we are all part of, is part of
the disease. This very illness is what we have been aiding to develop,
from its inception. This unit is what we have been working hard on, to
form our own senses of individuality. We wanted to stand out, and yet
all we do is just blend in. How can a formidable hunter become so
docile that he becomes the prey himself? Why do we throw away our
spears when they are all we have to give us the ability to fight back?
Our sensibilities have drifted away into black, bottomless pits, which
we have all contributed to making.</p>


 <p>It is aggreging to our shoulders, to see that generations after
generations, we squander and believe that discoveries should always be
made for us, peeled off then fed to our mouths. What have we become as
sailors of the stars? Have we given up the drive to motivate ourselves
to see what is on the other side of the rainbow? Have we tame
ourselves too much, that we became willing to be incarcerated in zoos,
for the pleasure of others?  Or did we just flush out our sense of
power, to make ourselves stand out less, and mix more with the crowd,
greatly reducing our distinctiveness when viewed from afar? It seems
that, for now, we refuse to answer some questions, yet we retaliate to
the idea that we are being interrogated of things deemed to be simpler
than high school classroom lessons. But some things are common to us,
albeit not all: we are afraid to see how society may react to our
actions, no matter how silly or grave our actions may be. But on
matters of more weight, we readily blend in, because we do not want
rejection. Most of us are more than happy to think and move with the
herd, without any forethought.</p>


 <p>When we voluntarily attach to our legs, heavy chains and balls of
steel, we should not expect to be able to run around the colosseum
with ease. When we dare to explore uncharted territories, without
regrets, without dis-enchantments, without the necessity to have
another ship propel us forward, we have triumphed.</p>
