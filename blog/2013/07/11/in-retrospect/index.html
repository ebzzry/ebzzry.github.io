 <p>"What won&rsquo;t kill me will only make me stronger."</p>


 <p>I haven&rsquo;t fully appreciated what those words meant, until now.</p>


 <p>I have learned that aside from experience, there is another important
aspect, that life teaches us &ndash; survival. When we are at the brink of
collapse, breakdown, or even death, the most important things in our
life flashes before our eyes. When we take a lot of pain, and survive
it, we will live to tell the tale. We will live to share the story for
generations to come. When we endure, and embrace the necessary agony,
we are forced to think in retrospect. We are then forced to perform
analysis. We are then put into a position, wherein, we can no longer
procrastinate about the next ideal thing to do. I realized, that when
we survive the ordeal, something magical begins to happen. And as for
me, it came in the form of a rude awakening.</p>


 <p>Little did I know, that something critical was about to unfold. By not
denying my state, I was able to embrace the reward. It dawned on me
that when I was able to gasp back for air, I have unlocked parts of
myself that have remained unknown before. Slowly, like the rays of the
sun in the morning, touching the water droplets on a leaf, I came to
see myself, as if seeing my reflection on a pond, for the first
time. I found out that there have been many dormant parts of me, just
waiting to be awakened.</p>


 <p>At the apex of my agony, I have catapulted myself into
self-destruction. Due to rage, I have pointed my fingers at my
own self, without any forethought. I screamed at myself in contempt,
putting all of the blame on my shoulders. The worst part of
it was that I did them in haste. I was reckless, even to my own
self. I didn&rsquo;t know that I have already bred a whole colony of a
single species of worm, that has already been eating me, from the
inside, and manipulating me, to their own bidding. I have also even
been tempted, many times, to create promises to myself, promises that
eventually implied creating my own chaos and peril. I forgot to love
my own self.</p>


 <p>I have also asked myself, another important question. A question that
ultimately yielded sleepless nights, anxiety, and the inability to
fully grasp time and space, around me. I asked myself, "Was it
worth doing it?" It seemed to me that time, that whenever I think
about it, I open Pandora&rsquo;s box. And somehow, I always convinced myself
to open it, to see it for myself. I was very curious to know, what was
in it, despite warnings to my own self. Another curious soul, gave
his two cents, advising me that that was the wrong question to
ask. That I should seek for the correct answer, myself, as if trying
to find my own way back home.</p>


 <p>At one point, someone knocked on my door &ndash; it was regret. Despite his
seemingly pitiful state, I declined to let him in, no matter how
persistent he was. I knew that the moment I let him in, he&rsquo;d feel
immediately welcome to himself, and feel comfortable around the place,
as if it was his, in the first place. Every time he knocked on my
door, he asked if he was welcome. I boldly say no, every single
time. Setting the figures aside, I would have told myself that had I
not done it, I would have not experienced the pain. This is wrong in
many ways, because had I not done it, I wouldn&rsquo;t be there in the first
place, to ask that question. The ability to ask that question was a
testimony to the experience. Hindsight is 20/20.</p>


 <p>I have frequently heard the phrase "You shouldn&rsquo;t have given your
everything." That may have worked for them. That may have worked for
their methods, but definitely not for me. Why? Because you won&rsquo;t be
able to explore your own limits if you are the one yourself who will
put the limits, before you even explore. If you don&rsquo;t strive hard
enough, you won&rsquo;t get anywhere. You&rsquo;ll be stuck in the same place,
forever. If you won&rsquo;t give it your best shot for every chance that you
get, your actions will easily fall in the category of mediocrity. If
something is worth doing, it is worth doing it well.</p>


 <p>Our minds and bodies react to stimuli, and this also applies to its
meta-components, like our well-being, and mindset. When we over-train
our bodies, chances are, we&rsquo;ll experience an injury. However, when we
train our bodies, near our limits, just before the point of breakage,
we become stronger. So, knowing our limits is crucial to our
growth. Knowing when to stop is highly significant if we want to go
past our previously-held limits. That, by tip-toeing near our breaking
points, we unlock a greater potential.</p>


 <p>Armed with more knowledge, I am now more eager, to face any challenge,
even if it means braving a storm. I will cross my old boundaries, even
if it means getting wounded, again. I will dare the demons to come
right at me, for I will make them experience a thousand
deaths. Every time I will get knocked down, I will get back up again to
continue the fight. I will hit as hard as much as I could, as long
blood runs through my veins, and as long as I breath.</p>


 <p>In closing, I&rsquo;d leave the words of Charles Bukowski:</p>


 <p>"If you&rsquo;re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t even start."</p>
