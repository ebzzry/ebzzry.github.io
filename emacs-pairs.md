Emacs and Pairs
======================================================================

<center>2015-08-15 21:48:41</center>

In this post, I'll exclusively talk about _smartparens_ — a package
that you wish you should have used, earlier, presuming you don't use
it yet. If you're new to it, read along; if not, this may be a good
refresher.

_smartparens_ is one of those packages that drastically improves, and
changes how one uses Emacs. It's like having cybernetic limbs — it
makes you jump higher, and punch harder.

Take note, though, that the name is a misnomer, as it not only handles
parentheses. It handles just about anything that pairs, and it
performs those functions stellarly.


## Installation

Installing smartparens is straightforward:

```
M-x package-install RET smartparens RET
```


## Configuration

Let's enable smartparens on startup, and hook it with some major
hooks:

```lisp
(use-package smartparens-config
    :ensure smartparens
    :config
    (progn
      (show-smartparens-global-mode t)))

(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'turn-on-smartparens-strict-mode)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'turn-on-smartparens-strict-mode)
```

## Usage

Managing paired characters like parentheses, braces, brackets,
quotation marks, angle brackets, and other conceivable pair-able
characters has always been a pain. Other packages solve that problem
partially. However, they it still miss several points. In the code
snippets below, the `^` symbol will be used to represent point:

### Basics

In smartparens, when you input a pair-able character:

```clojure

(defn foo )
          ^
```

the matching pair gets inserted, too, and point is positioned inside
the pair:

```clojure

(defn foo [])
           ^
```


### Navigation

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(let [x "foo bar baz ... blah"])
                         ^
```

and you want to move point to the start of the string:

```clojure

(let [x "foo bar baz ... blah"])
         ^
```

Execute `sp-beginning-of-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-a</kbd>.

Conversely, to move point to the end of the expression:

```clojure

(let [x "foo bar baz ... blah"])
                             ^
```

Execute `sp-end-of-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-e</kbd>:

If you have the expression:

```lisp

(defun format-date (format)
  (let ((system-time-locale "en_US.UTF-8"))
    (insert (format-time-string format)))) ^

```

and you want to move point to `insert`:

```lisp

(defun format-date (format)
  (let ((system-time-locale "en_US.UTF-8"))
    (insert (format-time-string format))))
     ^
```

Execute `sp-down-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-down</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(str "foo" "bar baz qux")
    ^
```

and you want to move point just past `)`:

```clojure

(str "foo" "bar baz qux")
                         ^
```

Execute `sp-up-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-up</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(defn foo
  [bar]
  (let [x 0]
  ^ x))

```

and you want to move point after `bar`:

```clojure

(defn foo
  [bar]
  (let^[x 0]
    x))

```

Execute `sp-backward-down-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>M-down</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```lisp

(insert (format-time-string format))
                           ^
```

and you want to move point to `(format`:

```lisp

(insert (format-time-string format))
        ^
```

Execute `sp-backward-up-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>M-up</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(:require [clojure.string :as s])
          ^
```

and you want to move just past `]`:

```clojure

(:require [clojure.string :as s])
                                ^
```

Execute `sp-forward-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>

Conversely, to move it just before `[`:

```clojure

(:require [clojure.string :as s])
          ^
```

Execute `sp-backward-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-b</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(defn blah
  "Returns blah of foo."
  [foo]                 ^
  )

```

and you want to move point to `[foo]`:

```clojure

(defn blah
  "Returns blah of foo."
  [foo]
  ^)

```

Execute `sp-next-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-n</kbd>.

Conversely, to move it back:

```clojure

(defn blah
  "Returns blah of foo."
  [foo]                 ^
  )

```
Execute `sp-previous-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-p</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(defn blah [] (let [x 0 y 1] (+ x 1)))
               ^
```

and you want to move point to `blah`:

```clojure

(defn blah [] (let [x 0 y 1] (+ x 1)))
      ^
```

Execute, `sp-backward-symbol`. I bound it to <kbd>C-S-b</kbd>.

Conversely, if you have the expression:

```clojure

(defn blah [] (let [x 0 y 1] (+ x 1)))
            ^
```

and you want to move point just after `(let`:

```clojure

(defn blah [] (let [x 0 y 1] (+ x 1)))
                  ^
```

Execute `sp-forward-symbol`. I bound it to <kbd>C-S-f</kbd>.

What they do is that they navigate around expressions as if
delimiters, like parens, brackets, and braces do not exist.


### Manipulation

If you have the expression:

```javascript

var mods = "vars";
           ^
```

and you want `"vars"` to be surrounded by `[`, and `]`:

```javascript

var mods = ["vars"];
            ^
```

Press <kbd>C-M-Space</kbd> followed by <kbd>[</kbd>, the
whole region becomes surrounded by matching `[`, and `]`.
It also applies to keys like `(`, `{`, `"`, `'`, `*`, `_`, etc,
depending on the mode that you're using.

Alternatively, define wrapping functions:

```lisp
(defmacro def-pairs (pairs)
  `(progn
     ,@(loop for (key . val) in pairs
          collect
            `(defun ,(read (concat
                            "wrap-with-"
                            (prin1-to-string key)
                            "s"))
                 (&optional arg)
               (interactive "p")
               (sp-wrap-with-pair ,val)))))

(def-pairs ((paren        . "(")
            (bracket      . "[")
            (brace        . "{")
            (single-quote . "'")
            (double-quote . "\"")
            (back-quote   . "`")))
```

I bound the first three functions to <kbd>C-c (</kbd>, <kbd>C-c [</kbd>,
and <kbd>C-c {</kbd>, respectively. So, if you have the expression:

```clojure

(defn foo args (let [x 0] (inc x)))
          ^
```

and you want to surround `args` with `[` and `]`:

```clojure

(defn foo [args] (let [x 0] (inc x)))
           ^
```

Press <kbd>C-c [</kbd>.

Sometimes, we inadvertently delete one of the pair characters — this
results in an unbalanced expression. smartparens prevents us from
doing that. If you hit <kbd>Backspace</kbd> in this expression:

```javascript

var mods = ["vars"];
            ^
```

Nothing will happen. smartparens saves us a lot of trouble, here.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

[foo bar] baz
        ^
```

and you want `baz` to be part of `foo` and `bar`:

```clojure

[foo bar baz]
        ^
```

Execute `sp-forward-slurp-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-right</kbd>.

Conversely, if you want to remove `baz`:

```clojure

[foo bar] baz
        ^
```

Execute `sp-forward-barf-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>M-right</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

blah [foo bar]
             ^
```

and you want `blah` to be part of `foo` and `bar`:

```clojure

[blah foo bar]
             ^
```

Execute `sp-backward-slurp-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-left</kbd>.

Conversely, if you want to remove `blah`:

```clojure

blah [foo bar]
             ^
```

Execute `sp-backward-barf-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>M-left</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

"foo" "bar"
      ^
```

and you want `"foo"` and `"bar"` to switch places:

```clojure

"bar" "foo"
      ^
```

Execute `sp-transpose-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-t</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(let [x "xxx" y "y yy yyy" z 0])
               ^
```

and you want to kill just `"y yy yyy"`:

```clojure

(let [x "xxx" y z 0])
               ^
```

Execute `sp-kill-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-M-k</kbd>.

If you want to kill `"y yy yyy" z 0`:

```clojure

(let [x "xxx" y])
               ^
```

Execute `sp-kill-hybrid-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>C-k</kbd>.

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(:require [clojure.string :as s])
                                ^
```

and you want to kill `[clojure.string :as s]`:

```clojure

(:require )
          ^
```

Execute `sp-backward-kill-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>M-k</kbd>

If you have the expression:

```clojure

(foo (bar x y z))
     ^
```

and you want to unwrap the `bar` expression, removing the parentheses
around `foo`:

```clojure

foo (bar x y z)
    ^
```

Execute `sp-backward-unwrap-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>M-[</kbd>

Conversely, if you want to unwrap the `bar` expression, removing the
parentheses around `bar`:

```clojure

(foo bar x y z)
     ^
```

Execute `sp-unwrap-sexp`. I bound it to <kbd>M-]</kbd>.

## Conclusion

The plethora of commands in smartparens may be daunting at first, but
the investement in time in learning them, will be minimal compared to
benefits that you will reap.
