Division in Haskell

While learning about division in Haskell, I realized that the concept is not as trivial as I
initially wanted it to be. There are subtle differences between the functions that can easily trip
someone who’s not aware of them. `quot` performs integer division that rounds towards zero. `div` is
like `quot`, but it rounds below zero—negative infinity. `rem` returns the remainder of a
division. `mod`, on the other hand, performs modular arithmetic.

In the GHCi interaction below, `quotRem` returns a tuple of the application of `quot` and `rem` to its
arguments, while `divMod` returns a tuple of the application `div` and `mod` to its arguments.

```
Prelude> quotRem 13 5
(2,3)
Prelude> quotRem (-13) 5
(-2,-3)
Prelude> quotRem 13 (-5)
(-2,3)
Prelude> quotRem 5 13
(0,5)
Prelude> quotRem (-5) 13
(0,-5)
Prelude> quotRem 5 (-13)
(0,5)
Prelude> divMod 13 5
(2,3)
Prelude> divMod (-13) 5
(-3,2)
Prelude> divMod 13 (-5)
(-3,-2)
Prelude> divMod 5 13
(0,5)
Prelude> divMod (-5) 13
(-1,8)
Prelude> divMod 5 (-13)
(-1,-8)
```

Giving special attention to negative numbers, here are some observations about it:

- `quotRem` and `divMod` behave the same, if all the arguments are positive.

- `quot` returns `0`, if the dividend is less than the divisor.

- `rem` follows the sign of the dividend.

- `rem` returns the dividend, if the dividend is less than the divisor.

- `div` rounds off the divisor to the negative infinity, if either the dividend or divisor is
  negative.

- `mod` follows the sign of the divisor.

- `div` returns `0`, if the dividend is less than the divisor, and both arguments are positive.

- `mod` returns the dividend, if the dividend is less than the divisor, and both arguments are
  positive.

- `div` returns `-1` if the dividend is negative, and its absolute value is less than the divisor.

- `quot` and `div` returns `0` if the dividend is `0`, and the divisor is not zero.

- `mod` returns the difference of the absolute values of the divisor and the dividend, following the
  sign of the divisor, if either the divisor or the dividend is negative.
