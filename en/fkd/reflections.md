This page contains contains some of my personal reflections. Entries are sorted in chronological order.


- While the intrepid ones are braving the storms with courage and triumph, the cowards are basking
  in the shores of submission and conformity.<br>


- Curiosity is the enemy of ignorance, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.<br>


- Golden opportunities are often missed because they are cloaked with dirty garment, rather than
  with glitter and gold.<br>


- When you don’t give your best, and unfavorable results come out, you’ll wonder what would have
  happened had you done your finest.<br>


- Challenge. Persist. Conquer.<br>


- Unless we will have the boldness and audacity to drive them away, our greatest fears will not
  leave us.  If, however, they are there to stay, then we should have the strength and courage to
  tame them.<br>


- If your ship doesn’t come to you, swim to it; if you can’t swim, have the ship towed to you.<br>


- Smile, even in the face of adversary, for that will also be the time that you’ll embrace
  victory.<br>


- If you want to create the future, focus on the moment rather than the outcome.<br>


- You answers, no matter how confident you are with them, are incorrect, if they were for the wrong
  questions.<br>


- If you can’t beat them, arrange to have them beaten.<br>


- Procrastinate procrastination.<br>


- Defer to use what you will use to defer.<br>


- Work your way through things, not around it.<br>


- Irrationality is a choice.<br>


- Stand out, then blend in.<br>


- Even stars die.<br>


- Impatience is the twin of impulsiveness.<br>


- Opinions are biases.<br>


- A nation is only as strong as its weakest peoples.<br>


- We think that we know.<br>


- When the rules change, adapt. If you can’t nor want to adapt, change the rules.<br>


- Diplomacy as a result of non-choice is no diplomacy at all.<br>


- If you can’t join them, beat them.<br>


- With great power comes great irresponsibility.<br>


- Never attribute to malice what incompetence will explain. Never attribute to incompetence what
  nature will explain.<br>


- Choices are illusions; there are only circumstances.<br>


- Reality is relative.<br>


- Take care of your shell, because it’s the only one that you have.<br>


- In the grand scale of the universe, human lives are insignificant. We are selfish with our lives
  because they are our own. However, we should remind ourselves, that for life to flourish, there
  must also be death.<br>


- Tell me what you care about, and I’ll tell you who you are.<br>


- The form of a question determines the form of the answer.<br>


- Power without control is nil; control without power is nil.<br>


- A true master knows that he’ll never become one.<br>


- One of the most satisfying yet most difficult thing to learn, is how to unlearn.<br>


- People gossip about other people because their own lives are too uninteresting.<br>


- However less you use social networking, use lesser.<br>


- The most difficult lies to detect are the ones that are mixed with the truths.<br>


- Humans have the amazing ability to resist invention, progress, and innovation. They frequently
  advertise their ability to mold and change themselves. The truth, however, is that those are mere
  projections of what they want to achieve, not what they have.<br>


- We get so hung up in goals, when the only the real tangible goal in life, is death.<br>


- If you were told that you are eventually going to die, will you still want to live?<br>


- Relationships, unlike wars, are not battles. We give back, we take in, we fall in love, we get
  hurt, we love again. Nothing is definite. We don’t know what happens next. But nothing will
  happen, if we do nothing.<br>


- We didn’t have the option whether to board the ship or not. We just find ourselves, in the middle
  of the journey, after the ship has already left the port.<br>


- The only thing that binds us to our loved ones are our memories.<br>


- Reality is not fixed.<br>


- The more I err, the more I become right.<br>


- What I do not understand, I rewrite.<br>


- Whatever you do, never be afraid.<br>


- Tell me what are your temptations and I will tell you what you are.<br>


- Letting go is one of the most difficult things, that we must do.<br>


- Let’s not fear pain, because feeling pain is one of the best ways to become stronger.<br>


- In the face of the cosmos, we all are children forever.<br>


- Fraudulent news spread because fraudulent humans exist.<br>


- I thank all of you who caused me pain; because without you I will not become stronger.<br>


- Know the work that pays your bills and know the work that defines your future.<br>


- Everything and nothing matters. Meaning is our invention. It is an attempt to quantify, qualify, and justify our perceived existence.<br>


- The key of discovering the future is not about solving more problems; it is discovering more problems.<br>


- We can’t solve those which we think does not need solving.<br>


- Social networking is an animal that you must not tame.<br>


- Never underestimate physical forces.<br>


- The universe does not have an obligation to mean anything to us. Since the beginning of time, it
  was always us, who wanted to give meaning to everything.<br>


- The most important things to consider when creating a universe from nothing are the initial
  conditions. Everything depends on it.<br>


- The definition of life is blurry—a black hole is as alive as a bacteria. The attributes of life
  which we have given to it, strongly depends on our relationship to the life forms that we are
  acquainted with.<br>


- If life is a big game, it can be surmised that everything is some kind of entertainment.<br>


- Death by irrelevance is worse than physical death.<br>


- The basic element of life is recognition.<br>


- The amount of energy needed to refuse is higher than the amount of energy needed to accept.<br>


- It doesn’t matter how much training you receive if you want to swim deep in the ocean. You cannot  learn lungs.<br>

- In all wars, all of the participants get injured.<br>

  contrivance of humans?<br>

- The usual things are the ones that pose the worst dangers.<br>


- The moment that you think you need to go faster, is the moment that you need to go slower.<br>


- The concept of balance of the universe is the direct result of human inclinations to believe that
  it indeed exists.<br>


- Demonstration of intelligence does not imply intelligence.<br>


- The things that people show, are the things they want you to see.<br>


- Don’t give rewards to all the participants. If rewards are given even to the losers, soon they
  will realize that they don’t deserve it.<br>


- Whenever you meet someone new, do not trust them. Only with time, one knows if they deserve
  it.<br>


- My body is my shell. My mind is my playground.<br>


- If you do what everybody else does, you’ll get what everybody else gets.<br>


- The golden rule is an example of a bad idea. If one thinks, that it is a good idea to hurt
  themself, then, it is also a good idea to hurt others.<br>

- The true value of a pen is not about its brand name; it is about the one who uses it.<br>


- Don’t forget, that when you pluck a flower from the earth, you are killing it.<br>


- Don’t thank someone of good things because of circumstances; thank someone because of good intentions.<br>


- You can’t teach a chicken how to shoot, because it can’t.<br>


- Doubt; always doubt.<br>


- One of the things that continually disturbs me is, that I am ignorant of many
  things. Additionally, of all those things, I am most ignorant of reality.<br>


- It is futile to think how you can fly like a falcon if you are an
  orca. Instead, it is far better to aim how you can become a stronger
  orca.<br>


- In a noisy room, if you want to be heard, wait for the moment wherein everyone has stopped
  talking. Then, speak. Then, one becomes heard.<br>


- If you know all kinds of pain, you become master of pleasure.<br>


- Never make important decisions when you are hungry, drunk, angry, tired, injured, sleepy, drugged,
  ecstatic, or dismal.<br>


- There are a lot of reasons to be sad, however, there are even more reasons to be happy.<br>


- Letting go is not the same as giving up.<br>


- The most abominable forms of evil are the ones that present itself as
  benevolent.<br>


- Never chase the unworthy and misleading goals. Rejoice, that there are
  mountains, the sky, and the sea. Be happy and content, that you still breathe
  air.<br>
