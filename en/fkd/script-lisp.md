Full-fledged systems and libraries have always been a comfortable zone for Common Lisp
users. However, for a long time, there has not been a definitive solution in using CL as a scripting
language. A scripting language, in this context, means something that is similar in spirit to
command line shells—that is, one that is used to issue, control, and manage system commands on the
application level. The meaning also extends to the automation of the execution of tasks that are
otherwise done one-by-one. In this article, I will give a short introduction on how to use CL in the
scripting domain.

<a name="overview"></a>Overview
--------------------------------

One of the most common questions I get when I mention that I want to do scripting in CL, is that why
would I want to do so and is it possible. The answer is simple: I want more power and
expressivity. I want a mature and unencumbered language. I want a language that is able to express
my ideas, in least amount of friction.

A script is only as powerful as the language and tools would allow. Bash and friends, for example,
are great for expressing ideas, as if you are typing them on the command line itself. It emulates
that behavior inside a script. You can define functions to do subroutines, but they’re just
that. Functions in Bash are nowhere near functions in languages like CL. As an interactive user
shell, it works fine; other than that, no.

Other scripting solutions exist in other languages. Haskell, Python, Scheme, and Ruby, to name a
few, has it. However, there’s a neat feature of CL, that is difficult to implement or non-existent in
other approaches: since the scripts themselves are valid CL programs, I can load the programs
in the REPL and do nice things with it. Nothing comes close to the flexibility that CL provides when
interacting with live, running programs.

In this short tutorial, I will also lightly gloss about one nice thing with CL scripting: multi-call
binaries. A multi-call binary is a single executable file that can be dereferenced with many
names. Each name corresponds to a specific subroutine inside that single binary. The beauty of this
approach is that instead of managing many different programs, you only manage one, and it will
dispatch the correct subprogram that a user wants. This is similar to what Busybox is doing. In CL,
this is handled by [cl-launch](https://github.com/fare/cl-launch).


<a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
------------------------------------------

Scripting in CL works on top of the language, that is, in the form of libraries that provide the
abstractions to interact with the system and
environment. [Utilities for Implementation- and OS- Portability (UIOP)](https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf/tree/master/uiop) is
a set of abstractions that lets us use and write portable CL code. It does the heavy lifting of
making sure that we are going to write portable Lisp code. UIOP is part of ASDF3—which is part of
most modern CL implementations—so there is no need to manually install
it. [inferior-shell](https://github.com/fare/inferior-shell) helps us with managing
processes. [cl-scripting](https://github.com/fare/cl-scripting) helps us with more process control.

The program `cl-launch` must also be installed in your system. It will be responsible in creating
the multi-call binary, itself. To install `cl-launch` on systems that use APT:

    $ sudo apt-get install -y cl-launch

To install on systems that use Nix:

    $ nix-env -i cl-launch


<a name="basics"></a>Basics
----------------------------

### <a name="paths"></a>Paths

To get started, let’s create a new project directory. We will build our project in
`$HOME/common-lisp`.

    $ mkdir -p ~/common-lisp/my-scripts

This directory is one of the standard paths that ASDF will crawl, for `.asd` files. It is worth
nothing that it doesn’t matter if `$HOME/common-lisp` is a regular directory or a symlink to one.


### <a name="definitions"></a>Definitions

Then, let’s create `my-scripts.asd` in that directory. To start, it will contain the following:

```lisp
#-asdf3.1 (error "ASDF 3.1 or bust!")

(defsystem "my-scripts"
  :version "0.0.1"
  :description "CL scripts"
  :license "MIT"
  :author "Muno VAKELO"
  :class :package-inferred-system
  :depends-on ((:version "cl-scripting" "0.1")
               (:version "inferior-shell" "2.0.3.3")
               (:version "fare-utils" "1.0.0.5")
               "my-scripts/main"))
```

Some of the features that we need are in ASDF 3.1, so we need to conditionalize the whole system. We
declare dependencies on `cl-scripting`, which provides some helpers; and `inferior-shell`, which
provides the things that we need for managing shell processes

Next, let’s create the file `main.lisp`, in the same directory. It will contain the following:

```lisp
(uiop:define-package :my-scripts/main
    (:use #:cl
          #:uiop
          #:cl-scripting
          #:inferior-shell
          #:fare-utils
          #:cl-launch/dispatch)
  (:export #:getuid
           #:symlink
           #:help
           #:main))

(in-package #:my-scripts/main)

(exporting-definitions
  (defun getuid ()
    #+sbcl (sb-posix:getuid)
    #+cmu (unix:unix-getuid)
    #+clisp (posix:uid)
    #+ecl (ext:getuid)
    #+ccl (ccl::getuid)
    #+allegro (excl.osi:getuid)
    #-(or sbcl cmu clisp ecl ccl allegro) (error "no getuid"))

 (defun symlink (src)
   (let ((binarch (resolve-absolute-location `(,(subpathname (user-homedir-pathname) "bin/")) :ensure-directory t)))
     (with-current-directory (binarch)
       (dolist (i (cl-launch/dispatch:all-entry-names))
         (run `(ln -sf ,src ,i)))))
   (success))

 (defun help ()
   (format! t "~A commands: ~{~A~^ ~}~%" (get-name) (all-entry-names))
   (success))

 (defun main (&rest args)
   (format t "main~%")))

(register-commands :my-scripts/main)
```

We’re going to start by using `UIOP:DEFINE-PACKAGE`. Unlike `DEFPACKAGE`, this creates the necessary
environment that is friendly to UIOP. In the `:USE` clause, we’re going to use helpers from other
libraries. In the body of this file, you can see `EXPORTING-DEFINITIONS`. This marker effectively
marks the boundaries of what will be created as an executable, or not. It will be used by
`REGISTER-COMMANDS`, later.

Here, we define several functions: `SYMLINK` is responsible for creating the symlinks for the
multi-call binary; `HELP` displays some basic usage information; and `MAIN` is the
entrypoint of our script. The multi-call binary will be available in `$HOME/bin/`. To make it
convenient to build the script and the symlinks, we’re going to put the build instructions in a
Makefile. Create the file `Makefile` in the current directory, then put in the following:

```Makefile
NAME=my-scripts
BINARY=$(HOME)/bin/$(NAME)
SCRIPT=$(PWD)/$(NAME)
CL=cl-launch

.PHONY: all $(NAME) clean

all: $(NAME)

$(NAME):
	@$(CL) --output $(NAME) --dump ! --lisp sbcl --quicklisp --system $(NAME) --dispatch-system $(NAME)/main

install: $(NAME)
	@ln -sf $(SCRIPT) $(BINARY)
	@$(SCRIPT) symlink $(NAME)

clean:
	@rm -f $(NAME)
```

In the `$(NAME)` target, we call `cl-launch` with options to build the script. In the `install`
target, we invoke the script with the options `symlink $(NAME)`, to build the symlinks for the
multi-call binary. Since we only defined three functions within the body of `EXPORTING-DEFINITIONS`,
it is only going to build three symlinks to `my-scripts`. The `‑‑output $(NAME)` option specifies
the output file. The `‑‑dump !` means to create an image, to enable a faster startup. The `‑‑lisp sbcl`
option specifies that we want to use SBCL, for this script. The option `‑‑quicklisp` specifies that
we load [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org) with the image. The `‑‑system $(NAME)` loads the
system the we are building. The `‑‑dispatch-system $(NAME)/main` specifies the entrypoint of our
program.


### <a name="building"></a>Building

We are now ready to build the script and the symlinks. To do that, run:

    $ make install

This will build the multi-call binary—`./my-scripts` and the corresponding symbolic links. The
directory tree of `~/bin` should look like the following:

```bash
$ tree ~/bin
/home/vakelo/bin
├── getuid -> my-scripts
├── help -> my-scripts
├── my-scripts -> /home/vakelo/common-lisp/my-scripts/my-scripts
└── symlink -> my-scripts

0 directories, 5 files
```

To test that it indeed works, run:

    $ getuid

If it displays your UID, we’re good to go.


<a name="more"></a>More
-----------------------

Say, you want to know the battery status of your laptop from the command line. We can define that
with several functions. Let’s modify `my-script.asd` to contain the additional declaration:

```lisp
#-asdf3.1 (error "ASDF 3.1 or bust!")

(defsystem "my-scripts"
  :version "0.0.1"
  :description "CL scripts"
  :license "MIT"
  :author "Muno VAKELO"
  :class :package-inferred-system
  :depends-on ((:version "cl-scripting" "0.1")
               (:version "inferior-shell" "2.0.3.3")
               (:version "fare-utils" "1.0.0.5")
               "my-scripts/main"
               "my-scripts/general"))
```

Then, let’s populate the file `general.lisp` with the following contents:

```lisp
(uiop:define-package #:scripts/general
    (:use #:cl
          #:fare-utils
          #:uiop
          #:cl-scripting
          #:inferior-shell
          #:cl-launch/dispatch
          #:optima
          #:optima.ppcre
          #:local-time)
  (:export #:battery
           #:screenshot))

(in-package #:scripts/general)

(defvar *screenshots-dir*
  (subpathname (user-homedir-pathname) "Desktop/"))

(defun battery-status ()
  (let ((base-dir "/sys/class/power_supply/*")
        (exclude-string "/AC/"))
    (with-output (s nil)
      (loop :for dir :in (remove-if #'(lambda (path)
                                        (search exclude-string (native-namestring path)))
                                    (directory* base-dir))
            :for battery = (first (last (pathname-directory dir)))
            :for capacity = (read-file-line (subpathname dir "capacity"))
            :for status = (read-file-line (subpathname dir "status"))
            :do (format s "~A: ~A% (~A)~%" battery capacity status)))))

(exporting-definitions
 (defun battery ()
   (format t "~A" (battery-status))
   (values))

 (defun screenshot (mode)
   (let* ((dir *screenshots-dir*)
          (file (format nil "~A.png" (format-timestring nil (now))))
          (dest (format nil "mv $f ~A" dir))
          (image (format nil "~A/~A" dir file)))
     (flet ((scrot (file dest &rest args)
              (run/i `(scrot ,@args ,file -e ,dest))))
       (match mode
              ((ppcre "(full|f)") (scrot file dest))
              ((ppcre "(region|r)") (scrot file dest '-s))
              (_ (err (format nil "invalid mode ~A~%" mode))))
       (run `("xclip" "-selection" "clipboard" "-t" "image/png" ,image))
       (success)))))

(register-commands :scripts/general)
```

In the definition of `BATTERY`, it outputs the return value of `(BATTERY-STATUS)`, in a human
friendly way, i.e., sans the double quotes. The `BATTERY` function then returns no values. We need
to do this because we only want the output of the call to `BATTERY-STATUS`.

The function `SCREENSHOT`, on the other hand, takes a screenshot with *scrot* then makes the
absolute path of the image available from the clipboard selection, using *xclip*. We use the
libraries `local-time`, for the date string and library; and `optima`, for the pattern matching. For
the command `screenshot` to work, install the binary dependencies. Run the following commands for
Debian and Nix systems, respectively:

    $ sudo apt-get install -y scrot xclip

    $ nix-env -i scrot xclip

Launching and managing user applications is easy. Let’s start by adding a dependency in
`my-scripts.asd`:

```lisp
#-asdf3.1 (error "ASDF 3.1 or bust!")

(defsystem "my-scripts"
  :version "0.0.1"
  :description "CL scripts"
  :license "MIT"
  :author "Lolu VAKELO"
  :class :package-inferred-system
  :depends-on ((:version "cl-scripting" "0.1")
               (:version "inferior-shell" "2.0.3.3")
               (:version "fare-utils" "1.0.0.5")
               "my-scripts/main"
               "my-scripts/general"
               "my-scripts/apps"))
```

Then, let’s populate `apps.lisp`:

```lisp
(uiop:define-package #:scripts/apps
    (:use #:cl
          #:fare-utils
          #:uiop
          #:inferior-shell
          #:cl-scripting
          #:cl-launch/dispatch)
  (:export #:chrome
           #:kill-chrome
           #:stop-chrome
           #:continue-chrome))

(in-package #:scripts/apps)

(exporting-definitions
 (defun chrome (&rest args)
   (run/i `(google-chrome-beta ,@args)))

 (defun kill-chrome (&rest args)
   (run `(killall ,@args chromium-browser chromium google-chrome chrome)
        :output :interactive :input :interactive :error-output nil :on-error nil)
   (success))

 (defun stop-chrome ()
   (kill-chrome "-STOP"))

 (defun continue-chrome ()
   (kill-chrome "-CONT")))

(register-commands :scripts/apps)
```

Let’s rebuild my-scripts:

```bash
$ make install
my-scripts available commands: battery chrome continue-chrome getuid help kill-chrome main screenshot stop-chrome symlink
```

Yay!


<a name="caveats">Caveats</a>
-----------------------------

An important thing to note is that in the definitions, you can’t use a CL keyword as the name of
the command. So inside `EXPORTING-DEFINITIONS`, you can’t have something like this:

```lisp
(exporting-definitions
  (defun t (&rest args)
    (run/i `(terminator ,@args)`)))
```

If you do, and try to compile the file, your CL implementation will complain about a name that is
already in use.


<a name="closing">Closing Remarks</a>
--------------------------------------

It has been said many times that CL has already faded into obscurity; that no one longer uses it;
that it is no longer useful. No, that is not true. Just because it is not being discussed in
mainstream news, means it is dead or have fallen out of favor. CL is a standardized language, and a
program that conforms to the standard has the guarantee—to an extent—that it can still run in the
future. To create a language standard is a monumental task—it requires that different, possibly
conflicting parties, to agree to how things should be done. There are different implementations of
CL, and each implementation strives to achieve goals that may not necessarily be compatible with
other implementations. That’s OK, because it gives room for implementors and designers, on how to
work on the base specifications. As long as they conform to the standard, things are green.

[baf](https://github.com/ebzzry/baf), a Nixpkgs and NixOS helper, is a working example of CL
scripting. [pelo](https://github.com/zhaqenl/pelo/), a ping wrapper, is also another example that
uses this facility. I wrote several personal helper
[scripts](https://github.com/ebzzry/scripts/), that I hooked with my StumpWM
[config](https://github.com/ebzzry/stumpo/). The code used for this article can be found
[here](https://github.com/ebzzry/my-scripts).

The human responsible for making scripting in CL possible and acceptable, is
[François-René Rideau](http://fare.tunes.org). It was 
[this blog entry](http://fare.livejournal.com/184127.html) that motivated me to see the viability of CL as a scripting language. You may send your
