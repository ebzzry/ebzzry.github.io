How many times have you experienced hindsight, after a catastrophic event has happened? How many
times have you told yourself that had you created backups of your precious data, you wouldn’t be in
that dire situation, pulling your hair out, like a rabid maniac?

Most of us have been there—we lost our precious files due to inadvertent causes. We lost them
because of disk crash, data corruption, security breach, and other reasons. But had we created a
fallback—a big, safe foam that we can land on—it wouldn’t have been a lot of trouble and heart
ache. On the flip side, creating and managing backups can be daunting and equally dangerous.

In this post, I’ll talk about
[Ugarit](https://www.kitten-technologies.co.uk/project/ugarit/doc/trunk/README.wiki), a nice piece of technology, that combines ease-of-use and security, in a single tool.

<a name="overview"></a> Overview
--------------------------------

Ugarit is a classic example of a tool, that requires minimal setup and configuration. That, once the
initial tinkering is done, all you need to do is reuse the tool. But that isn’t Ugarit’s main
strength—it is the almost unholy marriage of convenience and security.

Most, if not all the time, convenience is inversely proportional to security. That is, the more
convenient something is, the less secure it is. With Ugarit, creating and managing backups is as
easy as typing a short command.


<a name="installation"></a> Installation
----------------------------------------

### <a name="apt"></a> APT

First, you need to install [Chicken](https://www.call-cc.org/). Most likely, it can be installed via
your package manager:

    $ sudo apt-get install chicken-bin

If it isn’t available on your system, you may download it from
[code.call-cc.org](https://code.call-cc.org/).

After Chicken is installed, let’s install Ugarit itself, and its dependencies:

    $ chicken-install -s ugarit tiger-hash aes

After this command completes, the command `ugarit` will become available. To display usage:

    $ ugarit -h


### <a name="nix"></a> Nix

If you’re using Nix, just run the following command:

    $ nix-env -i ugarit


<a name="configuration"></a> Configuration
------------------------------------------

Ugarit at this point isn’t usable, yet—you need to specify where should it store the
snapshots. When creating a snapshot of a directory several terabytes big, it is ideal to store the
data on a fast, reliable, stress-tolerant disk. It is not uncommon for the command `ls` to
experience a noticeable lag when ran inside the data directory. Let’s presume that `/dev/sdb1` is a
large filesystem and you want to mount it to `/ugarit/`.

    $ sudo mkdir /ugarit
    $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /ugarit
    $ sudo chown -R $USER /ugarit

Another, equally important requirement that you need to have is its config file, usually named
`ugarit.conf`. It is supplied as part of the required command line arguments. It is important to
note, that this file does not reside in a fixed location, in contrast with some programs that look
for a config file at start-up. But before you actually create that file, you need to run some
commands. Save the outputs of these commands, because you’ll be needing them later:

Create a salt, for the hash function:

    $ dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=64 2>/dev/null \
    | base64 -w 0 \
    | tail -1

Create a key, for the vault:

    $ dd if=/dev/random bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null \
    | od -An -tx1 \
    | tr -d ' \t\n'

After you run those commands, you’ll create the config file, `ugarit.conf`. To make it consistent
with the example above, you’ll store it inside `/ugarit`:

    $ emacs /ugarit/ugarit.conf

Put the following, replacing SALT and KEY, with the salt and key strings that you generated
above.

```scheme
(storage "backend-fs splitlog /ugarit /ugarit/metadata")
(file-cache "/ugarit/cache")
(hash tiger "SALT")
(encryption aes "KEY")
(compression deflate)
```

Save the file, then secure it.

    $ chmod 600 /ugarit/ugarit.conf


<a name="basic"></a> Basic usage
--------------------------------

### <a name="create"></a> Creating snapshots

To create a snapshot, run:

    $ ugarit snapshot /ugarit/ugarit.conf TAG DIRECTORY

_TAG_ is a name that you will identify the snapshot with later, while _DIRECTORY_ is the filesystem
tree that you will create a snapshot of. To create, for example, a snapshot of the directory
`pictures/`, with the tag `pix`, run Ugarit like this:

    $ ugarit snapshot /ugarit/ugarit.conf pix pictures

After the snapshot, you’ll see something similar to the following:

```
Archiving pictures to tag pix...
Root hash: ddc888c86db6d7c468a27cc4af9b2907d219936df82e0971
Successfully snapshotted pictures to tag pix
Snapshot hash: ab290399f31fff1e3158c0ede8f90f59b2b41387af48f597
Written 910460 bytes to the vault in 4 blocks, and reused 0 bytes in 0 blocks
(before compression)
File cache has saved us 1 file hashings / 638104 bytes (before compression)
```


### <a name="explore"></a> Exploring Snapshots

To interactively manage the contents of the vault, run:

    $ ugarit explore /ugarit/ugarit.conf

To list the available commands:

    > help

Taking hints from the help usage, you’ll extract a directory that was part of the snapshot
earlier. Let’s say that the original path of that directory was `pictures/holiday/`. So, to extract
the directory `holiday/` to the current directory, run:

```
> cd pix
/pix> cd current
/pix/current> cd contents
/pix/current/contents> get holiday
Extracted holiday
/pix/current/contents> exit
```


### <a name="extract"></a> Extracting Snapshots Directly

If, however, you know the exact path to a file or directory that you want to extract, you can
instead run Ugarit with the extract mode. To extract the directory `holiday/` from above, directly,
run:

    $ ugarit extract /ugarit/ugarit.conf /pix/current/contents/holiday


<a name="tips"></a> Tips
------------------------

### <a name="remote"></a> Remote filesystems

Ugarit is not limited to creating snapshots of a local filesystem. It can also be used to create
snapshots of trees from a remote host mounted locally. If you have
an [SSHFS](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) mount, for example, you can still create a
snapshot of it, just like any other local filesystem:

    $ sshfs remotehost:/ ~/mnt/sshfs/remotehost
    $ cd ~/mnt/sshfs
    $ ugarit snapshot /ugarit/ugarit.conf remotehost

The same applies to [SMBFS](https://www.samba.org/samba/smbfs/) mounts:

    $ sudo mount -t cifs -o user=$USER,uid=$USER //winhost/c \
    ~/mnt/smbfs/winhost/c
    $ cd ~/mnt/smbfs
    $ ugarit snapshot /ugarit/ugarit.conf winhost


### <a name="miscellany"></a> Miscellany

To disable output, when creating snapshots:

    $ ugarit snapshot /ugarit/ugarit.conf -q ...

To enable very verbose output:

    $ ugarit snapshot -:a256 /ugarit/ugarit.conf ...


<a name="notes"></a> Notes
--------------------------

When you are doubtful of the performance of the disk where you’ll be storing the snapshots, disable
the [locate and updatedb](http://linux.about.com/od/commands/fl/updatedb-Linux-Command-Unix-Command.htm) service. It is
usually run periodically via cron. It places a lot of load on the disk, and may over-stress it. Your
mileage may vary.

To disable locate on NixOS, add the following to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
services.locate.enable = false;
```

An important caveat worth mentioning is that, due to the way Ugarit works, snapshot deletions do not
exist. The storage mechanism works similarly to Git, only that there are no rebase options.
