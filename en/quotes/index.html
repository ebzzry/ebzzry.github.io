Small people always do that, but the  really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.”<br>  ―Mark Twain</li></ul><ul><li>“However little television you watch, watch less.”<br>  ―David McCullough</li></ul><ul><li>“It’s not at all important to get it right the first time.

Feynman</li></ul><ul><li>“Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.”<br>  ―Richard P. Feynman</li></ul><ul><li>“The intellectual level needed for system design is in general grossly underestimated.

Tell me how much you get done.”<br>  ―James J. Ling</li></ul><ul><li>“There is no reason to assume that the universe has the slightest interest in intelligence—or even  in both. Life may be random accidental by-products of its operations like the beautiful patterns  on a butterfly’s wings. The insect would fly just as well without them.”<br>  ―Arthur C.

But you can always control what goes on  inside.”<br>  ―Wayne Dyer</li></ul><ul><li>“If you love a flower, don’t pick it up. Because if you pick it up, it dies and ceases to be what  you love. So if you love a flower, let it be. Love is not about possession. Love is about  appreciation.”<br>  ―Osho</li></ul><ul><li>“Forgive others not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.”<br>  ―Jonathan Lockwood Huie</li></ul><ul><li>“Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.”<br>  ―C.S. Lewis</li></ul><ul><li>“There is no thrill like that felt by the inventor as he sees his creation unfolding to  success. Such emotions make a man forget, food, sleep, friends, love, everything.”<br>  ―Nikola Tesla</li></ul><ul><li>“Don’t rely on someone else for your self-worth; only you can be responsible for that.”<br>  ―Stacey Charter</li></ul><ul><li>“The first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you  are.”<br>  ―J.P.
