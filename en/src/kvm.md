Most of you are familiar
with [full virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_virtualization) solutions like VMware
Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels. In this post, I‚Äôll re-introduce you to another, arguably
faster, way of doing things.

The `$` symbol will be used to indicate the shell prompt for a regular user, while the `#` symbol
will denote the shell for the root user. There are cases when
the [EUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier#Effective_user_ID) of a command will be
zero (0) due to the use of sudo.

Setup <a name="setup"></a>
--------------------------


### Hardware <a name="hardware"></a>

One of the first things that you need to do is to
enable
[Hardware-assisted virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization),
also called accelerated virtualization, in your hardware. If your CPU was made before 2006, chances
are, this feature won‚Äôt be present on your chip. Also, take note that this step is not compulsory to
make use of the virtualization solution described in this post, but it will _significantly_ speed
things up.

To enable accelerated virtualization, go into your BIOS/UEFI settings, and look for the knob that
enables this feature. The name into which it goes is different from manufacturer to
manufacturer. Save the settings, then boot your system. You can verify on the command line if your
system indeed recognizes it.

    $ egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

If it returns some text, then you‚Äôre good.


### Software <a name="software"></a>

Next, you need to install the essential applications.

Nix:

    $ nix-env -i qemu vde2 spice

APT:

    $ sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm vde2 spice-client

This will install the [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Main_Page) /kee-MOO/
hypervisor, [VDE](http://vde.sourceforge.net/) tools, and [SPICE](http://www.spice-space.org/)
support. QEMU, at least during its early days had the _meh_ impression‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is OK, but not
stellar. Since version 0.10.1, QEMU started supporting [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/), a
virtualization subsystem for Linux, that provides near-native virtualization performance using
hardware-assisted virtualization. It even rivals the performance of the virtualization solutions
mentioned above.

Other suites offer the option of connecting to the guest machine‚Äôs display via VNC. The problem is
that, it‚Äôs slow and clunky. The response time is just horrible. Using
the [SPICE](http://www.spice-space.org/) protocol, not only does it makes things faster, but it
makes other things possible. Take note that SPICE is not a replacement
for [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing), but rather, it a different way
of meeting your goals.


Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
------------------------------------------


### Images <a name="images"></a>

QEMU supports an array of image types, however the [QCOW2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qcow)
format is the most flexible, and feature-rich, for QEMU use.

If you have an existing VirtualBox file (VDI), you can convert it to QCOW2 with:

    $ qemu-img convert -f vdi -O qcow2 vm.vdi vm.qcow2

However, if you don‚Äôt have an image, yet, you can create one with:

    $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 vm.qcow2 20G

The last step creates a 20GB image, that is named `vm.qcow2`. Take note that the extension name
doesn‚Äôt really matter‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou can name your image as `index.html`, but that wouldn‚Äôt make a lot of
sense, right? üòÑ


### Networking <a name="networking"></a>

QEMU supports [many ways](http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Documentation/Networking) of setting up
networking for its guests, but for this post we‚Äôll use VDE.

You need to run several commands to prep the networking environment. Ideally, you‚Äôd want to save
these in a shell function, or a shell script:

```bash
$ sudo vde_switch -tap tap0 -mod 660 -group kvm -daemon
$ sudo ip addr add 10.0.2.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link set dev tap0 up
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.2.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
```

The above commands will:

1. Create a VDE device
2. Configure the TCP/IP options for that device
3. Enable the VDE device
4. Enable packet forwarding on the host OS
5. Setup the routing configuration


Execution <a name="execution"></a>
----------------------------------

### Load the image <a name="loadimage"></a>

You now need to invoke `qemu-kvm`, the command that will launch everything up. The name of the
command may differ with the one installed on your system.

If you‚Äôre installing an OS from a bootable image, usually an ISO file, run:

```bash
$ sudo qemu-kvm -cpu host -m 2G -net nic,model=virtio \
-net vde -soundhw all -vga qxl \
-spice port=9999,addr=127.0.0.1,password=supersecretkey \
-boot once=d -cdrom installer.iso \
vm.qcow2
```

On subsequent uses:

```bash
$ sudo qemu-kvm -cpu host -m 2G -net nic,model=virtio \
-net vde -soundhw all -vga qxl \
-spice port=9999,addr=127.0.0.1,password=supersecretkey \
vm.qcow2
```

Let‚Äôs break that down:

    -cpu host

Use the KVM processor with all the supported features

    -m 2G

Allocate 2GiB of host memory for the guest. Adjust as necessary.

    -net nic,model=virtio -net vde

Create a virtual NIC, and enable VDE networking

    -soundhw all

Enable all audio drivers

    -vga qxl

Specify the video adapter to emulate. Use QXL when using SPICE

    -spice addr=127.0.0.1,port=9999,password=supersecretkey

Specify the options for SPICE, separated by commas. _addr_ and _port_ are the IP address and TCP
port that SPICE will listen on. Ideally, access to that port must be properly configured, and
secured. _password_ is key that will be used by the SPICE client, _spicec_, to connect to the guest
display later.

    -boot once=d -cdrom installer.iso

Boot initially from `installer.iso`, then on subsequent boots, boot in the normal order.

Running the _qemu-kvm_ command above will load the image, but you won‚Äôt be able to view the display,
yet.


### Connect to the SPICE display <a name="display"></a>

To be able to use the guest machine‚Äôs display, you need to connect to
the SPICE server, using the SPICE client `spicec`:

    $ spicec -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5901 -w supersecretkey

Take note that closing the spicec window will not kill the QEMU session. If the guest OS captures
the mouse input, press <kbd>Shift+F12</kbd>, to get out of it.


### Configure guest networking <a name="guestnetworking"></a>

Next, you need to properly configure the network configuration of the guest OS so that it can
connect to the rest of the local network, and to the internet if the host machine has access to it.

IP address:

    10.0.2.2

Default gateway:

    10.0.2.1

DNS servers:

    8.8.8.8
    8.8.4.4


Closing the curtains <a name="closingcurtains"></a>
---------------------------------------------------


### Restore networking <a name="restorenetworking"></a>

If you want to explicitly revert the network configuration, do the following.

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 10.0.2.0/24 \
-j MASQUERADE
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
$ sudo ip link set dev tap0 down
$ sudo ip link delete tap0
$ sudo pkill -9 vde_switch
$ sudo rm -f /run/vde.ctl/ctl
```

The above commands will:

1. Revert the routing configuration
2. Disable packet forwarding
3. Disable the VDE device
4. Delete the VDE device
5. Kill the VDE process
6. Remove control files


Putting it all <a name="all"></a>
---------------------------------

Here are all the commands from above, compiled into functions, so that they can be ran from the
command line:

```
function kvm-net () {
  case $1 in
    down|0)
      sudo iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 10.0.2.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
      sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
      sudo ip link set dev tap0 down
      sudo ip link delete tap0
      sudo pkill -9 vde_switch
      sudo rm -f /run/vde.ctl/ctl
      ;;
    up|1)
      sudo vde_switch -tap tap0 -mod 660 -group kvm -daemon
      sudo ip addr add 10.0.2.1/24 dev tap0
      sudo ip link set dev tap0 up
      sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
      sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.2.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
      ;;
  esac
}

function kvm-load () {
  sudo qemu-kvm -cpu host -m 2G -net nic,model=virtio -net vde -device AC97,addr=0x18 -vga qxl -spice port=5900,addr=127.0.0.1,disable-ticketing -daemonize $@
}

function kvm-display () {
    spicec -p 5900 -h 127.0.0.1
}
```

I‚Äôll walk you through.

Initially, setup the netoworking:

    $ kvm-net up

Then, load the image:

    $ kvm-load vm.qcow32

Finally, connect to the display:

    $ kvm-display


Closing remarks <a name="closing"></a>
--------------------------------------

QEMU supports a myriad of cool options that we‚Äôve not even discussed here, including saving and
loading states (snapshots), creating screen and audio grabs, and a whole lot more. To learn more
about them, click [here](http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Main_Page).

QEMU with KVM is a powerful, fast, and flexible solution for
doing [Full Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_virtualization). At least in my case,
it out-performs the well-known options in the market. If you want to contribute to this project,
head over to their [GitHub page](https://github.com/qemu/qemu).

I hope this post helped you, in one way or another, learn more about QEMU and KVM and what it has to
offer.
