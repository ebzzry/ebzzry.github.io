Moving from LiveJournal to Frog with livefrog
=============================================

There are times when you want more control over your content. There are also times when you don’t
want another platform to dictatet what goes in or out. Issues like censorship and politics, can
easily creep up on a blogging platform. I found specific cases wherein I needed to convert
LiveJournal articles to another platform. There are tools that does this, however, I found none, so
far, that translates to _Frog_ files. This is my feeble attempt to achive that.

Overview <a name="overview"></a>
----------------------------------------

livefrog is a utility written in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), used to migrate LiveJournal posts
to [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog/), a blogging platform written in Racket, too. It
uses the files dumped by either [ljdump](http://hewgill.com/ljdump/),
or [ljmigrate](https://github.com/ceejbot/ljmigrate).


Installation <a name="installation"></a>
----------------------------------------

livefrog is available via Racket’s [Planet2](https://pkg.racket-lang.org):

```bash
$ raco pkg install livefrog
```

If that doesn’t work, you can alternately install by fetching livefrog, and the dependencies, from
github

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jbclements/sxml.git
$ git clone https://github.com/greghendershott/frog.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ebzzry/livefrog.git
$ raco pkg install frog/ sxml/ livefrog/
```

The trailing slashes are important, to tell `raco` that you are installing from local
directories. Without it, it will try to fetch the sources from the internet.


Usage  <a name="usage"></a>
---------------------------

This sections contains instructions for creating files suitable for use with Frog.


### Basics <a name="basics"></a>

To create a Markdown file from the file entry.xml

```bash
$ raco livefrog -m entry.xml
```

That, however, becomes cumbersome if you’re going to manage more than a hundred entries. To
automatically “pick up” the files created by ljdump or ljmigrate, and convert them to Markdown.

```bash
$ raco livefrog -am
```

Bear in mind, though, that ljdump and ljmigrate differ on how the trees for the data are
created. ljdump has the following tree format, where **USERNAME** is your LiveJournal account name:

```bash
ljdump/
  build
  ChangeLog
  convertdump.py
  USERNAME/
    L-1
    L-2
    C-2
    L-3
    ...
  ljdump.config
  ljdump.config.sample
  ljdump-gui.py
  ljdump.py*
  README.txt
  TODO
```

ljmigrate, on the other hand, uses a different format:

```bash
ljmigrate/
  LICENSE.text
  ljmigrate.cfg
  ljmigrate.cfg.sample
  ljmigrate.py*
  README.md
  README_windows.txt
  TODO
  www.livejournal.com/
    USERNAME/
      entry00001/
        entry.xml
      entry00002/
        entry.xml
        comment.xml
      html/
      metadata/
      userpics/
```

After creating the Markdown Frog source files, you may now copy them to your Frog source directory,
designated at `_src/posts/`


### Comments <a name="comments"></a>

Frog, by default, uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com) to handle the comments. To import comments to
this platform, you need to generate an XML file that must adhere to Disqus’s comment import rules.

To create a file, named `comments.xml` that will be used for importing comments, to be used
with <https://import.disqus.com>, using `foo.bar.com` as the root site:

```bash
$ raco livefrog -s foo.bar.com -c comments.xml
```


Updating <a name="updating"></a>
--------------------------------

If you installed livefrog using Planet2, you can update it by running:

```bash
$ raco pkg update livefrog
```

However, if you used the latter method, you may update it by pulling the updates, uninstalling
livefrog, then installing it again:

```bash
$ cd livefrog
$ git pull origin master
$ cd ..
$ raco pkg remove livefrog
$ raco pkg install livefrog/
```


Miscellany <a name="miscellany"></a>
------------------------------------

To reduce typing, you may optionally create an alias to `raco livefrog` in your shell.

Sh-like shells:

```bash
$ echo 'alias livefrog="raco livefrog"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Csh-like shells:

```bash
$ echo 'alias livefrog raco livefrog' >> ~/.cshrc
```

Replace `.bashrc`, and `.cshrc`, with the appropriate init file for your shell.
