Some are committed intentionally to manipulate and deceive, while some are committed unintentionally due to ignorance. Fallacies are divided into two kinds—formal and informal. Formal fallacies, also called logical fallacies, are expressed in a system like propositional logic. Informal fallacies are errors in the content of the premises.</p><p>In this post I’ll briefly go through some of the common fallacies encountered in our daily lives. Some are hidden in plain sight while some creep into the corners and require a closer examination.</p><h2>Post hoc ergo propter hoc</h2><p>After X, Y happened. Therefore, X caused Y. When an event happened after another event, it is presumed that what happened before it must have caused it.</p><blockquote><p> “After Juana communed to Jibbers Crabst, her father recovered from  his illness. Praise Jibbers Crabst!” </p></blockquote><p>This is fallacious because she ignores the possibility that it may have been the medications given to her father, that made him well.</p><h2>Cum hoc ergo propter hoc</h2><p>During X, Y happened. Therefore, X is related Y. When an event happened together with another event, it is presumed that what happened with it must be relevant.</p><blockquote><p> “Oh my! Did you know that when I was moving here to New York, Cubao,  Pedro was doing so, too! Our minds must be connected by astral  forces!” </p></blockquote><p>This is fallacious because she doesn’t consider other factors like Pedro moving to that city because of his own volition, and not due to magic.</p><h2>Ad hominem</h2><p>This happens when instead of presenting a case against an argument, person A is instead attacked personally, by person B. This is done to discredit the person A, based on who he is, and not the argument that he holds.</p><blockquote><p> After Maria presented a compelling evidence on the failures of  democracy, Juan objected that we shouldn’t believe anything from a  woman who isn’t married, doesn’t have kids, and listens to weird  music. </p></blockquote><p>Maria’s personal status doesn’t not have any bearing on the validity her claims. Juan’s statements are irrelevant. What should be attacked are Maria’s argument, and not her personal standings.</p><h2>Tu quoque</h2><p>This is committed when a person’s argument are claimed to be false because that person is inconsistent with his words. This fallacy is also known as the “You, too” fallacy.</p><blockquote><p> Doctor: “Quit smoking because it is harmful to your health.”<br>  Patient: “You, yourself smoke, so I can’t follow your advice.” </p></blockquote><p>The patient rendered Maria’s statement to be invalid, because Maria smokes. If the patient presented an objection that smoking is <em>not</em> harmful to the health, then it would have been a better position.</p><h2>Loaded question</h2><p>This happens when a presumption is made beforehand, and that an answer is forced from constrained choices, like a “yes” or a “no”.</p><blockquote><p> “Juan, have you stopped cheating on your wife?” </p></blockquote><p>This is fallacious because the speaker assumes that Juan has cheated, at least once on his wife. If Juan answers “Yes”, then he has cheated on his wife before, and that he has already stopped. If Juan answers “No”, then he has cheated before, and still continues to cheat on her.</p><h2>False dichotomy</h2><p>This is committed when a person is forced to choose a position, or answer a question, with coerced limits. This is also called the black-and-white, or the either-or fallacy.</p><blockquote><p> “Either you’re a theist or an atheist.” </p></blockquote><p>This is fallacious because it presents extreme positions, even if there are other positions aside from those presented. In this case, the person being asked may be an agnostic.</p><h2>Hasty generalization</h2><p>This is committed when it is assumed that a part composes the whole. It is made when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is not large enough.</p><blockquote><p> “I was molested in childhood by a homosexual. Thus, all homosexuals  are vile creatures, and they must be punished!” </p></blockquote><p>The speaker assumed that just because he experienced one such incident in his life before, he concluded that all homosexuals molest children, and that must be treated with contempt and disgust.</p><h2>Sweeping generalization</h2><p>This is committed when a majority is assumed to compose the whole. It is made when a significant percentage is applied to the entire composition.</p><blockquote><p> “In all of the stores that I’ve gone to, there’s not a single one  that sells a blue-tipped Super Panda pen. That means, I won’t be  able to find such a pen in the whole country.” </p></blockquote><p>The speaker has given up the possibility that such a pen may exist, in one or more of the stores that he hasn’t visited, yet.</p><h2>Burden of proof</h2><p>This is committed when the responsibility to provide proof does not lie with person A, the one making claims, but with person B, to disprove the claims of person A.</p><blockquote><p> “Since you can’t prove the inexistence of a large cockroach that  defecates stars, that lives exactly 100,000 light-years away from  where I’m facing right now, then it must exist.” </p></blockquote><p>Instead of providing evidence to his own claims, person A shifts the burden of providing proof to person B. Since there are no physical ways for person B to prove that the claims of person A is invalid, person A presumes that his claims must be true.</p><h2>Slippery slope</h2><p>This is committed when something is presumed to happen next, due to another factor. That, if you allow X to happen, Y will follow suit. Therefore, X should not happen.</p><blockquote><p> “If we ban the use of firearms for civilians, then crime rate will  increase because there’ll be nothing that civilians can use to  protect themselves.” </p></blockquote><p>This fails to consider that majority of gun-related accidents happen in the homes of their own owners. This also assumes that civilians who own guns are responsible enough to wield such weapons.</p><h2>Red herring</h2><p>This is committed when an irrelevant topic is introduced to divert attention from the original argument. The “red herring” is injected, under the pretense that it is relevant to the original topic.</p><blockquote><p> Woman: “How do you plan addressing the issues about corruption?”<br>  Candidate: “I’m going to give everyone a job, and I’m going to lower  income taxes.” </p></blockquote><p>The goal is to abandon the original topic, to distract the listener. This is frequently observed in political interviews and discussions.</p><h2>Straw man</h2><p>This is committed when person B presents a distorted, weaker version of the argument that person A holds. Person B then attacks this weaker version, and if triumphant, concludes that person A’s argument is defeated.</p><blockquote><p> Juan: “Alcohol ads should be banned from mass media, because it  encourages underage drinking.”<br>  Pedro: “People have been drinking alcohol for a long time. They  will continue to do so.” </p></blockquote><p>Pedro misrepresents the position of Juan as: “People should give up drinking alcohol.” That is not what Juan said.</p><h2>Appeal to age</h2><p>This is committed when it is argued that very old or very young arguments are superior. This is frequently seen in marketing and advertising.</p><blockquote><p> “Our new and improved Super Bubbly Detergent Zet washes stain off  better than the leading products.” </p></blockquote><p>This fails to address why their products are superior to the others. Just because something is old or new, doesn’t make it better.</p><h2>Appeal to seniority</h2><p>This is committed when a person’s age is used to support the validity of his claims. This is usually applied against someone who is younger.</p><blockquote><p> “I’ve been in the business for 30 years. You’re only 34, what do you  know about language design.” </p></blockquote><p>It is assumed here, that just because someone is younger than him, makes him less qualified for the things that are being discussed.</p><h2>Appeal to authority</h2><p>This is committed when the actions, choices, and words of a person of authority, or expertise, is used to disprove the claims of another person.</p><blockquote><p> “The theory of evolution is wrong, because Kulas, who is a scientist  said that he doesn’t believe in it.” </p></blockquote><p>Just because someone is a scientist, doesn’t mean that he supports the <a href='http://notjustatheory.com/'>theory of evolution</a>. It is likely that even if he is a scientist, he doesn’t understand the theory of evolution.</p><h2>Appeal to anonymous authority</h2><p>This is committed when an appeal to authority is made, but the authority is not named. This makes it very difficult to verify the validity of the claims.</p><blockquote><p> “Experts agree that drinking a glass of Super Juice everyday will  make you healthier.” </p></blockquote><p>This fails because of the failure to specify who these so-called “experts” are.</p><h2>Appeal to false authority</h2><p>This is committed when an appeal to authority is made, but the authority in question is outside the scope of his expertise.</p><blockquote><p> “Pedro extensively studied and reviewed the efficacy of Liverdead  capsules, and asserted that they indeed improve liver health.” </p></blockquote><p>Pedro, however, is not qualified professional to study and review health products, nor does he have any substantial experience prior to conducting such a study.</p><h2>Appeal to popularity</h2><p>This fallacy states that if most people—relative to the speaker—chooses a specific position, then that position must be true. The basic idea is that a claim must be accepted as true on the grounds that people are favorable towards that claim.</p><blockquote><p> “The survey shows that most people are going to vote Juan for  president. Their choice must be correct. I’m going to vote for him,  too.” </p></blockquote><p>This happens when a person believes a claim on superficial bases. This usually happens due to biases. A choice is made not due to technical merits, but due to prejudices.</p><h2>Appeal to nature</h2><p>This fallacy is committed when it is argued that just because something is “natural” means it is good.</p><blockquote><p> “Juana claims that if a product is not labeled ‘organic’ or  ‘natural’, then it is not ideal for consumption.” </p></blockquote><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana&#95;tabacum'>Cultivated tobacco</a> (<em>Nicotiana tabacum</em>) is a plant that is responsible for more than five million deaths per year, around the world.</p><h2>Appeal to emotion</h2><p>This fallacy is committed when emotions are used to elicit a fallacious response from the target. The basic idea is that emotional tactics are used to persuade a person into believing that the argument being presented is valid.</p><blockquote><p> “Pedrito, eat your broccoli. Think about all the poor, starving, and  homeless children around the world who are unfortunate to even  eat three times a day.” </p></blockquote><p>Pedrito’s parent wants to make him eat the broccoli, by using emotional ploy, instead of providing substantial reasons for Pedrito to eat the broccoli.</p><h2>Appeal to force</h2><p>This fallacy is committed when the threat of force or violence is used to coerce a person to accept a claim to be true. This fallacy is very common in religious circles.</p><blockquote><p> “If you don’t listen to the words of Jibbers Crabst, you’ll burn in  the torturous flames of Kell.” </p></blockquote><p>Instead of providing a reason why someone should listen to Jibbers Crabst, threats of violence are instead used to force someone to follow blindly.</p><h2>Appeal to tradition</h2><p>This fallacy is committed when it is argued that just because something is traditional, or the norm, then it must be followed. This is found in religion and cultures.</p><blockquote><p> “It is customary for us to participate annually in the Kabobohan  March. You should join us, too.” </p></blockquote><p>This fails to state why one should join the said event. Instead it is argued that it should be done on the grounds that it is traditional.</p><h2>Begging the question</h2><p>This fallacy is committed when the thing to be proved is used as one of the premises. It is an example of circular reasoning.</p><blockquote><p> “The divine words of Jibbers Crabst are pure, splendid, and  impeccable because it says so in The Eternal and Transcendent Book  of Crabst.” </p></blockquote><p>This blatantly assumes the validity of the existence of such an entity, and to prove it means to assume that that entity exists, first. X because X.</p><h2>Selective observation</h2><p>This is committed when a conclusion is made from narrow and limited views. This is also called the cherry picking fallacy. Mass and social media is notorious of this.</p><blockquote><p> “Juana is living a happy and satisfying life because I frequently  see her posts on Facebook that she is happy.” </p></blockquote><p>The observer ignores the possibility that what he sees may not be true because Juana only posts what she wants people to see and believe.</p><h2>No true Scotsman</h2><p>This is committed when an argument is made by asserting that a behavior is only acceptable within the confines of certain standards.</p><blockquote><p> “Why don’t you eat with your bare hands? A true Dodoman should eat with  his bare hands!” </p></blockquote><p>This is a form of false purity. It asserts that there is one acceptable way for a Dodoman to eat. This is similar to appeal to tradition.</p><hr/><div style="text-align: right; float: right; max-width: 18em;"><a href='index.html'><img src="images/icon&#95;home&#95;01&#95;32x32.png" alt="Home" title= "Home" /></a> <a href='about.html'><img src="images/icon&#95;about&#95;01&#95;32x32.png" alt="GitHub" title= "About" /></a> <a href='quotes.html'><img src="images/icon&#95;quotes&#95;01&#95;32x32.png" alt="DeviantArt" title= "Quotes" /></a> <a href='words.html'><img src="images/icon&#95;words&#95;01&#95;32x32.png" alt="GPG" title= "Words" /></a> <a href='https://github.com/ebzzry/ebzzry.github.io'><img src="images/icon&#95;source&#95;01&#95;32x32.png" alt="SSH" title= "Source" /></a><div style="font-size: x-small">Site created with <a href='https://github.com/ebzzry/emem'>emem</a></div><p><div style="font-size: x-small"> <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png" /></a><br />This work by <a xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="https://ebzzry.github.io" property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL">Rommel M.
