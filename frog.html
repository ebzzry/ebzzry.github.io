However, there are instances when you want to have more control over your stuff. A good example of which are the constraints that providers enforce. Another is the presence of ads, or the use of freemium services, i.e., things can be done, only up to a certain visible limit.</p><p>One may argue that all they need is a platform to blog with, and that they don't need the extra flexibility. While that is fine, some of us, including me, want to be free from these shackles. I don't want ads on my site. I don't want surprise censorship. I don't want to pay for services that I can get for free. I want freedom. Now, if you're like me, then read on.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>When I was looking for tools to create this blog, I became dissatisfied with most of the mainstream options. Some are the just too difficult to setup, while some are lacking in features. I became frustrated because each end of the spectrum forces me to use something that is extremely mediocre in at least one critical aspect. Fortunately, I found <a href='http://github.com/greghendershott/frog'>Frog</a>, via a suggestion on <code>#racket</code>.</p><p>Frog, in layman's terms, is a site creator, that is very easy to use, configure, and customize. Whatever you write, will appear on your blog -- you get what you expect. There are no weird terms of use, nor arbitrary limits, nor coercion — it's very close to full control, at the tip of your fingertips.</p><p>Frog operates somewhere in the middle. That is, it looks like this:</p><blockquote><p>Raw Content -> <i>Frog</i> -> HTML </p></blockquote><p>Where raw content is either Markdown, Scribble, or HTML source files, or a combination of all. Frog takes in those input files, and it outputs nice HTML that you can upload to your web server. Easy? No, it's even easier that it sounds.</p><h2>Installation</h2><p>In the succeeding sections, let's presume that your username is <code>john</code>, and your home directory is <code>/home/john/</code>.</p><p>To install Frog, you need to install Racket, first. Chances are, your package manager already has it. To install Racket on Debian, run:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ sudo apt-get install racket
</code></pre><p>In the unlikely event that it can't be installed using your package manager, go to <a href='http://racket-lang.org/download/'>racket-lang.org/download/</a> , then follow the instructions from there.</p><p>Next, you need to install Frog.</p><pre><code class="bash">$ raco pkg install frog
</code></pre><p>After which, you'll get the <code>raco frog</code> command. Let's display its help options:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ raco frog -h
</code></pre><h2>First Use</h2><p>Sweet. Now that you have Frog installed, let's get rolling. To create your first Frog-powered website, you'll create a project directory first:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ mkdir blog
$ cd blog
</code></pre><p>You'll then fire the spark plug, to initialize the site repository:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ raco frog --init
</code></pre><p>You'll see a message saying that your website is ready. Let's follow the suggested command:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ raco frog -bp
</code></pre><p>What that command does is that it builds the HTML files from the sample source files created with the <code>--init</code> switch, then it runs a local web server, serving by default, the location <a href='http://localhost:3000'>http://localhost:3000</a>. Frog will then open a new browser tab, or window, pointing to that URL. The page that you'll see contains the default site layout. When you're OK with it, let's go back to the terminal, and kill that process by hitting <kbd>C-c</kbd>.</p><h2>Creating New Posts</h2><p>Creating a new article from scratch is another easy task:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ raco frog -n &quot;New Blog Post.&quot;
</code></pre><p>What it does is that it creates a Markdown file, relative to the current directory, with the format <code>&#95;src/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md</code>. With the command above, the absolute path would be similar to:</p><pre><code>/home/john/blog/&#95;src/posts/2014-02-21-new-blog-post.md
</code></pre><p>Let's edit that file, and see how it looks like:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ emacs &#95;src/posts/2014-02-21-new-blog-post.md
</code></pre><pre><code>    Title: New Blog Post
    Date: 2014-02-21T18:53:42
    Tags: DRAFT

&#95;Replace this with your post text. Add one or more comma-separated
Tags above. The special tag `DRAFT` will prevent the post from being
published.&#95;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
</code></pre><p>Bear in mind that this file, was created for you, by the command <code>raco frog -n ...</code>. The first three lines contains metadata about your post. They're the post title, date of creation, and tags, respectively. The date was picked up from the the <code>-n</code> switch that was issued, earlier. The <code>Tags</code> field, contains a comma-separated list of words, that Frog would later identify the post with. When the case-sensitive tag <code>DRAFT</code> is used, the file will be skipped during the build phase.</p><p>Four spaces must be prefixed, prior, to those three lines, followed by an empty line. The rest will be the actual article content, in Markdown format. When a line by its own contain just the text <code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</code>, that line will be replaced by a hyperlink in the final HTML form, that will point to the rest of the article. That means, all text, after the <code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</code> line will not appear in the blog index, but will appear in the link for the whole post.</p><p>Let's say you change that file to look something like the following:</p><pre><code>    Title: New Blog Post
    Date: 2014-02-21T18:53:42
    Tags: arts, history

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Donec
odio. Quisque volutpat mattis eros. Nullam malesuada erat ut
turpis. Suspendisse urna nibh, viverra non, semper suscipit, posuere
a, pede.

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

Donec nec justo eget felis facilisis fermentum. Aliquam porttitor
mauris sit amet orci. Aenean dignissim pellentesque felis.
</code></pre><p>Then, run the build command, again:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ raco frog -bp
</code></pre><p>You now have two posts, as displayed in the index. To remove the auto-generated initial post, that was created by the command <code>raco frog --init</code>, earlier, run:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ rm -f &#95;src/posts/2012-01-01-a-2012-blog-post.md
</code></pre><p>Then, rebuild the files:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ raco frog -bp
</code></pre><h2>Customizations</h2><p>By this time, you're really itching to customize the site. Yep, that's what you're going to do in this section.</p><p>At the basic level, there are three files that you are going to modify, to make your initial changes:</p><ul><li>.frogrc</li><li>_src/page-template.html</li><li>_src/post-template.html</li><li>css/bootstrap.css</li><li>css/bootstrap.min.css</li></ul><p>Let's examine each of the files in the list, closer.</p><h3>.frogrc</h3><p>This file is where top-level customizations are made. Open the file <code>.frogrc</code>, located in the current directory:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ emacs .frogrc
</code></pre><p>You'll notice that there are more than a dozen parameters that can be tweaked. But for now, you're only concerned about three parameters:</p><ul><li>scheme/host</li><li>title</li><li>author</li></ul><p><code>scheme/host</code> should contain the (sub)domain to which you'll be publishing your work later, <code>title</code> is the name of your blog, and <code>author</code> is your name.</p><h3>page-template.html</h3><p>This file contains the common content, across all types of pages, whether they are blog or non-blog posts. Open the file <code>&#95;src/page-template.html</code>, located in the current directory:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ emacs &#95;src/page-template.html
</code></pre><p>You'll see an even bigger file, compared to .frogrc. This is an special HTML file, that contains Racket, and Frog-specific code. It will be used as a basis for all pages that you'll create with Frog. There are plenty of parameters here, but you'll just tweak some that are most usable to you, at the moment. To make it easier, I'll just list down the items to search and replace for:</p><ul><li>The Unknown Blogger</li><li>My Blog Brand</li><li>Welcome</li><li>Your legal notice here</li></ul><p>When you get to those respective sections, it should evident what to replace them with.</p><h3>post-template.html</h3><p>Similar to <code>page-template.html</code>, but this file contains content that will only appear with blog posts. It is also Perhaps the easiest file to modify is <code>&#95;src/post-template.html</code>. Let's open it:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ emacs &#95;src/post-template.html
</code></pre><p>For now, you only need to modify the text <code>shortname</code>. It is the identifier that links the comments section of your blog posts, to the aforesaid Disqus account. More about this will be discussed in the section <i>Comments</i>.</p><h3>bootstrap.css and bootstrap.min.css</h3><p>These two files are responsible for what is commonly called as "theme" -- it controls the look of the site. To change these files, let's head over to <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">http://bootswatch.com/</a>, then let's select a theme you like. Let's presume that you want to download the <em>Cerulean</em> theme. Click the dropdown box arrow, next to the download link, for that theme. Select and download both <code>bootstrap.min.css</code> and <code>bootstrap.css</code>. After which, copy them over to the css subdirectory <code>css/</code>.</p><pre><code class="bash">$ cp &#126;/Downloads/bootstrap.&#42;.css css/
</code></pre><h2>Miscellany</h2><p>When you created a new post earlier, you used the following command:</p><pre><code class="bash">raco frog -n &quot;New Blog Post&quot;
</code></pre><p>That command, creates a Markdown source file. Frog, however, has another mode — Scribble. This mode lets you use a Scribble source file, instead. To create one, you'll use the following command:</p><pre><code class="bash">raco frog -N &quot;New Blog Post&quot;
</code></pre><p>Had you used this command earlier, the file will have the format <code>&#95;src/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md</code>. With the command above, the absolute path would look like:</p><pre><code>/home/john/blog/&#95;src/posts/2014-02-21-new-blog-post.scrbl
</code></pre><p>Again, let's edit that file, and see how it looks like:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ emacs &#95;src/posts/2014-02-21-new-blog-post.scrbl
</code></pre><pre><code>##lang scribble/manual

Title: New Blog Post
Date: 2014-02-21T18:53:42
Tags: DRAFT

Replace this with your post text. Add one or more comma-separated
Tags above. The special tag `DRAFT` will prevent the post from being
published.

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
</code></pre><p>They're mostly the same, except with the addition of the language specifier, <code>#lang scribble/manual</code>, and the absence of the prefix spaces for the metadata fields.</p><h2>Comments</h2><p>Frog makes use of <a href='http://disqus.com'>Disqus</a> to handle its comments. To use it, create an account at <a href='https://disqus.com/profile/signup/?next=http%3A//disqus.com/'>disqus.com/profile/signup/</a>.</p><p>When you already have your account, go to <a href="http://disqus.com/admin/create/">http://disqus.com/admin/create/</a> to create a site, which will have an alias called a <em>shortname</em>. The <em>shorname</em> is what you'll register with Disqus to uniquely identify your website. So, if you chose, for example, <code>foobar</code>, as the shortname for the site, you may then access <a href="http://foobar.disqus.com">http://foobar.disqus.com</a> to manage the comments for that site. The shortname mentioned here, is what you'll use in the file <code>&#95;src/post-template.html</code>, as discussed above.</p><p>To import comments, from an existing blog, to Disqus, go to <a href="http://import.disqus.com">http://import.disqus.com</a>.</p><h2>Show Time</h2><p>To publish your work, upload the contents of the directory that Frog manages; in this tutorial, it is the directory <code>/home/john/blog</code>, to your remote web server. If the current directory is <code>blog/</code>, and you want to send the files via rsync, the command would look like:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ rsync -avz ./ remotehost:public&#95;html
</code></pre><p>The directory <code>public&#95;html</code> could be something else, I just used it because it is the default with Apache.</p><p>However, if you don't have a remote host that you can upload your work to, via rsync, and you use <a href='http://git-scm.com'>Git</a>, you can use the free hosting service of <a href='http://pages.github.com'>GitHub Pages</a>. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, you may go to <a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a> to create one. To use, GitHub Pages, create a repository named <code>USERNAME.github.io</code>. So, if your username is <code>johndoe</code>, the repository that you need to create should be named <code>johndoe.github.io</code>.</p><p>To publish your work to GitHub Pages, you first need to add that remote repository:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ git remote add origin git@github.com:johndoe/johndoe.github.io.git
</code></pre><p>Then you push the commits:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ git push origin master
</code></pre><p>To view your website, go to <a href='http://johndoe.github.io'>johndoe.github.io</a>.</p><h2>Notes</h2><p><a href='https://github.com/greghendershott/frog'>Frog</a> is a viable and usable site creator. It is easy-to-use, highly configurable, flexible, and yes, open source. It gives control, back to the author.</p><p>Frog was created by <a href='http://www.greghendershott.com/'>Greg Hendershott</a>.
