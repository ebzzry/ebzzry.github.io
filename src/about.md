My name is Rommel M. Martinez. I am a software engineer, and systems
administrator. My interests are PLT, systems design, and automation.

I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) as my main system. I write most of my
programs in [Clojure](https://clojure.org), and
[Racket](https://racket-lang.org). I share my code at
<https://github.com/ebzzry>. From time to time, I post photographs on
<https://ebzzry.deviantart.com>.
