## Why <a name="why"></a>

One of the best investments a programmer can have is a good
keyboard. What constitutes a good keyboard, however, can sometimes be
a subject of debates. A common item that persists most lists is that
it has be ergonomic. I add to that list an important quality:
speed. No matter how ergonomic a keyboard is, if it falls on the speed
category. It has to be comfortable, and speedy.

The
[Kinesis Advantage](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/)
is the epitome of such a criteria. It is ergonomic, and it is fast. If
you are already proficient typist, you’ll find that after the small
adjustment period, you’ll type even faster with the Advantage. The
default layout of the keys, however, turns me off. The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
and <kbd>Alt</kbd> keys are too far to reach. This is important for
users of software like Emacs, and shells like Zsh and Bash.

Throughout this post, we will be using the following legend:

```
ES    Escape                       HO    Home
TA    Tab                          ED    End
CL    Caps Lock                    PU    Page Up
SL    Scroll Lock                  PD    Page Down
SH    Shift                        EN    Enter
lCT   Left Ctrl                    SP    Space
rCT   Right Ctrl                   DE    Delete
lAL   Left Alt                     PS    PrintScr
rAL   Right Alt                    KE    Keypad Enter
BS    Backspace                    KP    Keypad
IN    Insert                       PR    Progrm
```

## Before <a name="before"></a>

When using Dvorak emulation, the following is how the keys are mapped:

### Original Software Dvorak

Yuck. Using this layout on Emacs, or shell, is painful to the hands,
especially on prolonged periods. To press <kbd>M-x</kbd>, one would
have to press the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key with the right thumb, then the
<kbd>x</kbd> key with the left index finger. Reaching out for the
<kbd>Esc</kbd> keys isn’t a lot of fun, either, because it’s too far.


## After <a name="after"></a>

I remapped some of the keys, to fit my workflow. The new layout is as
follows. The mapping is initiated by pressing <kbd>PR +F12</kbd>.
Please check with the manual for other remapping-related
information.

### Remapped Software Dvorak

I used <kbd>Insert</kbd> in lieu of <kbd>Esc</kbd>, so that I can
easily access the `XA_PRIMARY` selection using <kbd>Shift +
Insert</kbd>. The `XA_PRIMARY` selection is where your mouse
highlights go. It also makes it easy to enter Emacs’s
`overwrite-mode`. The <kbd>Insert</kbd> key, however, is buried in the
key physically marked with `|`, on the left side. The sequence to
access it is listed at end of this post.

The new location of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> makes it easy
for the fingers to reach them. I swapped the location of <kbd>Up</kbd>
and <kbd>Down</kbd> with <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd>. I
wanted to be able to scroll through a webpage without having to use my
right hand with the mouse wheel. <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page
Down</kbd> were also moved to enable equal load distribution for two
hands.

One of my favorites is the new location of the
<kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd> keys. I also like the new location of
the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key—this allows me to easily hit the Esc key when
using vi, or to close dialog boxes.


## Setup <a name="setup"></a>

The `+` indicates pressing and holding a key, while pressing
another. The `➔` is read as “to”, for example, `PU ➔ HO` is read as
“Map PageUp to Home”. The `,` indicates a sequence of keys pressed and
released, in order.

```
PR + Shift + F10
PR + \
PR + -
PR + F12

ES ➔ CL
CL ➔ SL

LE ➔ UP
RI ➔ DN
UP ➔ LE
DN ➔ RI

HO ➔ ED
ED ➔ PD
PU ➔ HO
PD ➔ PU

lCT ➔ `~
lAL ➔ \|
rCT ➔ ]}
rAL ➔ [{
-_  ➔ lCT
=+  ➔ rCT
]}  ➔ rAL
`~  ➔ =+
r\| ➔ -_
[{  ➔ l\|

KP, IN, KP ➔ ES
KP, KE, KP ➔ lAL
```

The `KP_Enter` (KE) key was moved to `Left Alt` (lAL) so that I can
easily use it as a Compose (Multi) key in X. My `~/.Xmodmap` contains
the following:

```
keycode 104 = Multi_key
```
