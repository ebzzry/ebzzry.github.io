Emacs and Racket

In this post, I’ll discuss the easiest approach that I took to setup
up a [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) development environment on
Emacs. Take note, that this is not the only approach available — some
did it in arguably better ways. In this article, I’ll try to explain
the shortest route that I took.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Editing Racket code with Emacs has traditionally been done by
rudimentary modes that mostly lacked flexibility. They were able to
evaluate current definitions, last definitions, and entire buffers,
for the most part. Unfortunately, that didn’t suffice with the way
Racket dealt with things. A more intelligent way of handling code, was
needed.

Fortunately, you have [Geiser](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/).  There
are other major modes that try to do what Geiser does, but I became
most comfortable with what Geiser offered. Some similar libraries can
co-exist with Geiser, too. I tried those, but it became too complex,
for me. I wound up just using Geiser. Also, as a semi-related note,
I’m using Emacs to edit Racket code because I don’t know of any other
editor that does it so well. I don’t use DrRacket, except when I need
to use its nice GUI debugger.


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

My installation method is crude, but it works, at least for me. Other
installation methods exist, but I couldn’t wrap my brain around them,
so I opted instead for something that requires the minimal amount of
chore. Also, I’m still not sure what are the hidden consequences of
not doing it the “elegant” way, presuming there is one.

Let’s say that you want to install your Geiser files in
`~/.emacs.d/elisp/`. You’ll issue the following commands to install
Geiser to that location:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/.emacs.d/elisp
$ cd ~/.emacs.d/elisp
$ git clone http://git.sv.gnu.org/r/geiser.git
```

After that, in `~/.emacs.d/elisp/geiser/`, you’ll have something that
looks like the following:

```
AUTHORS
autogen.sh*
bin/
ChangeLog
configure.ac
COPYING
doc/
elisp/
.git/
.gitignore
INSTALL
Makefile.am
NEWS
README
README.elpa
scheme/
THANKS
```

Next, you want the directory `~/.emacs.d/elisp/geiser/elisp/` to be a
member of the Emacs variable `load-path` so that `require` and friends
will know where to find things. To do that, add the following to your
Emacs init file — either in `~/.emacs.d/init.el`, or in `~/.emacs`
(deprecated):

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/geiser/elisp/")
```

Next, you’ll put in the actual code that invokes and configures Geiser:

```lisp
(require 'geiser)

(setq geiser-active-implementations '(racket))

(defun geiser-save ()
  (interactive)
  (geiser-repl--write-input-ring))
```

The first expression loads Geiser, itself. The second one specifies
that it won’t prompt you for other implementations if it finds
them. The last one is optional — it enables you to execute
`M-x geiser-save RET` in the REPL buffer to force saving of the
history to the disk file, which is `~/.geiser_history.racket`, by
default. It is useful if you want to save your REPL session,
immediately (Nothing is more horrifying than losing **THAT**
expression). For all the Emacs code above, to take effect, you can
evaluate them now using members of the eval-* troupe (`eval-defun`,
`eval-last-sexp`, `eval-region`), or, you can still opt to respawn a
new Emacs process.


## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To reap what you sowed, create or open a `.rkt` file, with at least a
proper module declaration. Then hit:

```
M-x run-geiser RET
```

And, boomshakalaka! A new (Emacs) window opens, containing the
`* Racket REPL *` buffer. Whatever you can do with the REPL
invoked with vanilla command-line `racket`, you can also do with this,
and more. This major mode is actually Comint mode, under the hood,
with hooks to a a Racket process. For those of you who are unfamiliar
with Comint mode, it is the same mode that handles `M-x shell RET`.

So, what can you do with it? While editing `.rkt` file, here are some
of the usual shortcuts that I use (The full list of keys are
[available here](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/geiser_5.html#Cheat-sheet)). Take
note, that the description of the keys that I used below, are for
myself initially, to help me understand what they do. They may, or may
not diverge from the official description, listed on the
aforementioned link.

### Racket buffer <a name="racketbuffer"></a>

| Key     | What it does                                            |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| C-c C-z | Switch to the REPL buffer                               |
| C-c C-a | Evaluate current buffer, then switch to the REPL buffer |
| C-M-x   | Evaluate current expression                             |
| C-x C-e | Evaluate last expression                                |
| C-c C-r | Evaluate region                                         |
| C-c C-\ | Insert a lambda (λ) symbol                              |


### REPL buffer <a name="replbuffer"></a>

| Key     | What it does                        |
| :------ | :---------------------------------- |
| C-c C-z | Switch to the Racket buffer         |
| M-p     | Switch to the previous history item |
| M-n     | Switch to the next history item     |
| C-c M-p | Jump to previous prompt             |
| C-c M-n | Jump to next prompt                 |
| C-c C-q | Quit the REPL                       |


## Closing remarks <a name="closing"></a>

I have intentionally skipped many topics from the
[official document](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/) because it makes it
unattractive to people who are averse to reading long blocks of text
(ironically, this article may even qualify as one.). The methods
described above are by in no way representative of community-advised
ways of installing and using Racket with Emacs. Feel free to drop a
comment below! Ciao!
