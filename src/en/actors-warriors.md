<a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
---------------------------------------

I recently came across an article of Stephen Cuunjieng on Manila Times titled
[Where Are Quality Finance and Tech Jobs Going? (Not Here)](https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/12/19/opinion/columns/where-are-quality-finance-and-tech-jobs-going-not-here/2246675).
Here are my thoughts about it.

The tech industry is vast, so I’m going to limit my remarks to the software
industry since that’s where I am in.


<a name="background">Background</a>
-----------------------------------

I have been in the software industry for thirty years already. I started long
before it was even remotely called «Tech». I have seen fads go up and down. I
have witnessed how things have evolved through the course of those years. I now
head my own startup, partly as a response to what I’ve been seeing in the
country; partly due to patriotism. There are many reasons why the tech jobs are
not here in the Philippines. Some say economic reasons; some would say social
reasons. We can point our fingers in all directions. But no matter how much we
do that, it still avoids the true cause—the love for mediocrity.

When I was trying to break into the scene in the mid 90s, I was just a boy with
passion. Access to sophisticated machines was difficult. Access to time
resources was even more difficult. There was no Internet back then. So, how did
I learn? I spent a lot of time in public libraries, reading whatever I can get
my hands on, learning as much as I can. I did odd jobs just so I can have enough
fare and food to spend time in the those libraries. When dial-up internet access
became available, I would set aside a measly amount of money from my school
allowance, just so I would have enough time to sit down in public terminals for
15 minutes. That was more than enough time for me to download articles and store
them into my 360 KiB floppy disk. Fifteen minutes back then felt like forever.
The world was my oyster. It was exhilarating. I learned the art of teaching
myself.

Not long after, I had my first real job. I became a technician, web developer,
and graphic artist, all rolled into one. I have to thank the people who
supported and believed in me that time. Every day that I went to work was
blissful. The little salary that I got was nothing compared to what I was
learning. The difficulty of having to travel long distances in hot, noisy, and
uncomfortable buses under the scorching heat of the sun, just to deliver pieces
of hardware to a client was nothing. The ability to write source code to test
out my ideas and hypotheses was worth everything.

I went to college, briefly, but left soon after. I thought at that time that it
has got to be one of the worst things to do if one wants to be come a Software
Engineer. I still believe that, to this day. The highest formal education
attainment that I got is High School. I have no idea where my diploma is, nor do
I care about it. In that single semester of college, I failed all
computer-related subjects. Discussions about CPU scheduling bored me. Lectures
about computer programming felt so heavy and tedious. It wasn’t fun, at all. It
was drudgery. And so, I was there, sitting in the middle of the class, listening
to the incoherent babble of the instructor, when I finally decided to quit. I
surrendered my class cards to my professors, one by one, and told them I’m
quitting. I was 16 at that time.

During the start of my career, I have been lucky enough to work with and be
mentored by scientists, engineers, and researchers from Coordinated Science Lab
at the University of Illinois, École Nationale Supérieure des
Télécommunications, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Carnegie Mellon
University. I learned that the world out there is much bigger. I discovered that
there are countless ways to do things. I found the real magnitude and power of
CS with them. I also had the privilege of arguing and debating with them, over
things as trivial as missing commas, and things as important as understanding
intelligence.


<a name="unreality">Unreality</a>
---------------------------------

I believe, to this day, that for the most part, universities and colleges are
not equipped to teach students how to write high quality software. Most, if not
all, instructors are not part of the software industry so what they’re teaching
are not based on practical approaches. Most of the subject matter are also
obsolete. A lot of the lessons being taught are for the masses outside. The
programming languages taught in universities are inferior compared to industry
standards. The depth and breadth of the subjects are pitiful. A lot of what’s
happening inside are guesswork. Students graduate knowing nothing and render
themselves being completely unhirable.

Not too long ago, I have encountered things that seemed unreal, but were real.
One of those university programs is called «Operating Systems». I was impressed
at first that these schools offered them. However, upon closer examination, I
discovered that students are taught to just use simulated tools to understand
how systems work. They are not taught how machines work. They are not taught how
basic computer circuitry works. They are not taught how do bootloaders work.
They are not even taught how to use the command line to execute basic commands.
These institutions do not have the slightest clue of the true culture of real
Computer Science (CS). They see the education program as just using computers
for applied usage in trivial domains.

Soon after, I discovered that it was just the tip of the iceberg. Under programs
that are labeled «Software Engineering», I discovered that the professors and
instructor have not written real software, aside from «Hello World» programs.
Students are given trivial tasks to complete, in order to pass a subject. What’s
worse are these things «Hackathons» or whatever they’re called now. People
really believe that you can find true engineering skills with events like those.
The situation before, when I was 16 years old, and the situation now, are still
very much the same. Nothing has changed. There are no schools in the Philippines
with Software Engineering programs that are globally-competitive.

Here’s the twist with CS: no amount of skills and technical proficiency from
other fields of study can prepare you for it. Your 99% grade in school will not
translate to usable and practical software. The certificates that you got will
not equate to a single line of code. CS is a discipline in its own right. It is
so vast that it permeates every aspect of modern society now. It is so pervasive
that you have to intentionally be an ascetic in order to ignore it.
Understanding algorithms and data structures requires a different kind of
thinking not present in other fields.

-------------------------------------

For the past decade, I have been trying so hard to restrain myself to comment on
a subtopic—orators. During the past decade, I have seen an influx of
conferences, seminars, and symposia about «Technology», «Trends», etc. What’s
egregious is that the main people talking about those topics know nothing about
those things. I somehow always find myself in uncomfortable situations wherein I
ask the expert, directly, questions about what he presented, sometimes during
the presentation, more often, after. I thought that politicians are good at
dodging questions that are sensitive in nature. But lo and behold, I soon
discovered that the orators are actually better at it.

Then, there are the outlanders. These people have no real interest with CS, have
no technical proficiencies, and have nothing to contribute to the discussion.
The most interaction they have with machines was playing videogames. These are
the people that make a lot of noise on social media. They talk about the latest
trends. They talk about Web 3.0, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, NFT,
Artificial Intelligence, and just about any space that they want to hop on. The
amount of publicity that they have is inversely proportional to the amount of
technical knowledge they have over those domains. Some of them are real estate
agents, practicing lawyers, bankers, accountants, civil servants, and the
run-of-the-mill enthusiasts. At best, they’re just operators.

In any kind of market, there are different kinds of players. In a free market,
specifically, every participant is given a chance to make it big. One of most
important driving forces in a free market is competition as framed and
determined by supply and demand. The orators and outlanders have nothing to
contribute. They eat up the valuable space for aspiring players. They hog
discussions about inventions and innovations. They appear in mainstream media
with microphones. They lobby in the senate. They pump more and more air to
benefit only themselves. They don’t really care about economic growth.


<a name="organizations">Organizations</a>
-----------------------------------------

In a recent post that I made online, I said this, «When somebody claims that
they’ve been in the software industry for a long time, my immediate instinct is
to look for their credentials—open source code or technical articles. The
absence of those is the absence of credibility.» A lot of the responses talked
about NDAs and some such. Now, if I had to explain every nuance of that
statement, for every case, it would already become too lengthy. There was no
need for me to mention that there exists sensitive government contracts, private
records, and classified projects. There are also very good engineers that are
just not social enough, for them to justify sharing their work to the public.
There are also prolific engineers who run their entire enterprises but
contribute zero to the open source community. My former mentor is one of them.
For the rest, however, what I said applies.

To form a new software company—a startup even—you have two paths: 1) You’re
already an engineer, and you want to create a team that would address your
target markets; or 2) You’re not an engineer, and you want to hire people that
will form your engineering team. In both cases, you have to know how the
software industry works. There are no excuses. If you will solely rely on
advisers to tell you how to run the company; how to respond to crises; how to
talk to engineers; and how to market and sell then products, then your runway
will be very short. Unlike other industries, the software world changes at a
weekly pace. Yes, I’m not exaggerating. So your knowledge about things a few
months ago, may soon become obsolete the next thing you try to apply it. If you
believe the use of contemporary AI systems like generative artificial
intelligence will help, then you are most welcome to try to find out things for
yourself, or your company.

One of the reasons why Philippines is absent in the map for foreign investors
with regards to software production is because there’s nothing to invest on. The
quality of the software is poor. The tools are mediocre. The programming
languages used are the ones that are popular on TIOBE. The engineers are from
bootcamps. Collectively, this results to inflation of perceived value. It gives
the impression of the ability to produce, even if there’s none. Economically,
this is net negative. TAMs are imaginary. It’s a lose-lose situation. When you
see however, software that is being «developed» by a company, in the
Philippines, expect it to be outsourced from other countries. You know what
those countries are. You know where the money will flow to.

Software companies don’t strive to provide challenge. They see software as just
a means to an end, not an end in itself. Executives follow the latest news and
trends, closely, and decide their next major technical stack overhaul based on
what they saw. Most software companies, ironically, do not have what they call
the «hacker» culture. Hacker in this sense refers to the original meaning in the
MIT AI Lab—A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and
how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn
only the minimum necessary. What is present nowadays are depressed employees
typing manically with their keyboards in desperate attempts to produce something
useful.


<a name="closing">Closing remarks</a>
-------------------------------------

I have always had the option of just observing things from afar and minding my
own business. However, Taleb’s words sowed seeds of actions in me. It’s not a
problem of inability nor inadequacy. It’s a problem of perpective.  Having a
healthy attitude towards competition is key to unlocking these qualities. As
long as people believe that they have to rely on hand-me-downs in order to
flourish, they’ll be stuck. My story is not unique to me. There are countless
others who have done the same things. Education should not be be seen as a goal.
It should be seen a process, a continuing one. High-speed internet access is now
widely available.  There are no more excuses.
