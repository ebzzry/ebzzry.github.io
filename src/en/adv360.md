<a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
---------------------------------------

An upgrade is either something that is an improvement over the old version, or
it is something that is step back. It is rare too see a new version of a product
that can happily exist with the old one. That is the case with the Kinesis
Advantage and
[Kinesis Advantage360 Professional](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/).
I  wrote previously about the [Kinesis Advantage](/en/advantage/).

When I learned in 2022 that Kinesis was going to introduce a new line of Advantage
keyboards with the ability to remap the keys using software, and has wireless
connectivity, I became curious. I contacted my [Kinesis supplier from Japan](https://edikun.co.jp/), the
same company that I got my Advantage from. I got a reply within 24 hours and he said
that they indeed have the keyboard on stock. I ordered it. I was stoked.

It arrived by mail within two months. Now, that amount of time may seem long,
but for a premium product like it, it was worth it.

<a name="history">History</a>
-----------------------------

When the announcement of the new keyboard model came, I did extensive
research about it, learning everything that I can about it. I learned that it
uses the [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) firmware.  I learned that in order to re-define the keys, you use a
web tool hosted on GitHub. I learned that if you don't want that, you can still
edit the files containing the definitions, push them to GitHub and let it build
the firmware files for you. I learned that if you still don't want to use
GitHub, you can use Docker and Colima, instead.

I learned that it has excellent Bluetooth connectivity, and that it can happily
co-exist with your other Bluetooth devices without issues. I also learned that
you can buy an entire set of keycaps without labels on it. Cool.

When the device came, the first thing that I did was to replace the keycaps with
ones that don't have the labels on them. They just look better without them. I
then went ahead and paired the device to my machines. It was a fluid process.


<a name="basics">Basics</a>
---------------------------

Of course, I wasn't happy with the default layout and went on to change it. I'll
describe the steps that I took to change it.

First, you to go to the
[Adv360-Pro-ZMK](https://github.com/KinesisCorporation/Adv360-Pro-ZMK)
repository, then fork it. Next, enable Actions so that every time you push
changes to your repository, new firmware files are going to be built.

So, what I would do is to make changes in the
[web app](https://kinesiscorporation.github.io/Adv360-Pro-GUI/), save the
changes, then wait for the firmware files to be built. The firmware files will
be accessible from the Actions tab, click the appropriate job, then follow the
`firmware` link.

style="display: block; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
alt="Kinesis Adv360 Pro Keymap Editor" title="Kinesis Adv360 Pro Keymap Editor"/></a>

The resulting files will be `202501180513-70c6055-left.uf2` and
`202501180513-70c6055-right.uf2` for the left and right sides, respectively. The
filenames will be different, of course, when you do it. I rename them to
`left.uf2` and `right.uf2`, respectively, for convenience.

Connect one keyboard at at the time to you machine using the cable provided.  To
flash it, you enter the bootloader mode, by either pressing <kbd>Mod2+Bootloader</kbd> or
by double-tapping a small knob between the <kbd>Del</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, and
<kbd>End</kbd> keys. A paperclip should do it.

<div style="text-align: center;">
![Adv360 Bootloader Pin](/images/site/adv360-0.jpg "Adv360 Bootloader Pin")
</div>

A new volume will be mounted under `/Volumes/ADV360PRO/`, on macOS.

The keyboard would light green, indicating that it is ready for flashing. To
transfer the files to the keyboard, you run the following command:

```shell
rsync -avP left.uf2 /Volumes/ADV360PRO
```

The keyboard will display some dancing flash lights, then it will stop. Do the
same procedure for the other half, but this time with `right.uf2`

```shell
rsync -avP right.uf2 /Volumes/ADV360PRO
```

To bring them back up, turn the devices back on, and wait for them to
synchronize with each other. When you see a steady white light on the device,
you should be ready to go.


<a name="configuration">Configuration</a>
-----------------------------------------

After months of using the web app, I discovered that my workflow would be much
better if I directly edited the map files. The web app, while it works for a lot
of users, felt clunky to me.

I went on an adventure and actually learned more about the ZMK system works. I
discovered, that it's actually straightforward. The
[official ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs) is very helpful, here.

My attention went first to `config/adv360.keymap`, which looked like a C source
file:

```c

/* THIS FILE WAS GENERATED!

#include <behaviors.dtsi>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/bt.h>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/rgb.h>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/backlight.h>

...
```

What's nice are these things:

```c
behaviors {
  #include "macros.dtsi"
  #include "version.dtsi"
  #include "modmorph.dtsi"
};
```

which allowed me to decompose the configuration into different components.
`.dtsi` is short for Devicetree Source Include, which is a type of an
include file for [Devicetree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devicetree) configuration.


<a name="mod-morphs">Mod-morphs</a>
----------------------------------

The [mod-morph](https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors/mod-morph) behavior
allows you to define a key and another behavior, depending on what mods you
specify. I wanted to have the pair `9` and `<`, so that pressing
<kbd>Shift+9</kbd> would yield a `<`. The same with `0` and `>`.

To do so, I put the following in `modmorph.dtsi`

```c
n9_less: n9_less {
  compatible = "zmk,behavior-mod-morph";
  #binding-cells = <0>;
  bindings = <&kp N9>, <&kp LESS_THAN>;
  mods = <(MOD_LSFT|MOD_RSFT)>;
};

n0_greater: n0_greater {
  compatible = "zmk,behavior-mod-morph";
  #binding-cells = <0>;
  bindings = <&kp N0>, <&kp GREATER_THAN>;
  mods = <(MOD_LSFT|MOD_RSFT)>;
};
```

You can find the other mod-morphs that I use in
[modmorph.dtsi](https://github.com/ebzzry/adv360-pro-zmk/blob/V3.0/config/modmorph.dtsi).


<a name="macros">Macros</a>
---------------------------

Another interesting feature is
[macros](https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors/macros). It allows you to define
key presses or combinations, for your convenience. I wanted to make pressing
<kbd>Mod1+`</kbd> input six graves, then put the cursor in the middle. I use this
whenever I need to type Markdown code blocks.

To do so, I put the following `macros.dtsi`:

```c
m_graves: m_graves {
    compatible = "zmk,behavior-macro";
    label = "m_graves";
    #binding-cells = <0>;
    bindings = <&kp GRAVE>, <&kp GRAVE>, <&kp GRAVE>, <&kp GRAVE>, <&kp GRAVE>, <&kp GRAVE>, <&kp LEFT>, <&kp LEFT>, <&kp LEFT>;
};
```

You can find the other macros that I use in
[macros.dtsi](https://github.com/ebzzry/adv360-pro-zmk/blob/V3.0/config/macros.dtsi).


<a name="dvorak">Dvorak</a>
---------------------------

At first, I used the QWERTY layout for the main keys, modifying only the other
keys. Since I use Dvorak, I would change the keyboard layout of my desktop
enviroment using whatever the operating system provided. It meant that my
keystrokes are translated from QWERTY to Dvorak, to the operating system.

That seemed fine, at first, but the problem came when I had to use the keyboard
for my other devices. I had to make sure that all of the devices that I used the
keyboard with had to have a translation layer. 

I thought, why not just have the keyboard input Dvorak keys, instead. So, that's
what I did. I changed the definitions of all the keys so that they would emit
Dvorak keys. I should have done that a long time ago.

For the main layer, the [adv360.keymap](https://github.com/ebzzry/adv360-pro-zmk/blob/V3.0/config/adv360.keymap) file on the left half of the keyboard is

```c
&kp GRAVE       &kp N1       &kp N2       &kp N3       &kp N4       &kp N5
  &kp TAB      &kp SQT  &comma_semi   &dot_colon        &kp P        &kp Y
&kp EQUAL        &kp A        &kp O        &kp E        &kp U        &kp I
&kp LSHFT     &del_ins        &kp Q        &kp J        &kp K        &kp X
    &mo 1    &kp LCTRL     &kp LALT     &kp DOWN       &kp UP             
``` 

the right side is

```c
&kp N6      &kp N7        &kp N8       &n9_less    &n0_greater &kp BACKSLASH
&kp F       &kp G         &kp C        &kp R       &kp L       &kp SLASH    
&kp D       &kp H         &kp T        &kp N       &kp S       &kp MINUS    
&kp B       &kp M         &kp W        &kp V       &kp Z       &kp RSHFT    
            &kp LEFT      &kp RIGHT    &kp RALT    &kp RCTRL   &mo 1        
```

and the middle part is


```c
       &mo 2                                                 &mo 2       
&kp C_BRI_DN                                                 &kp C_BRI_UP
&kp C_VOL_DN    &kp LWIN  &kp PGDN    &kp PGUP  &kp RWIN     &kp C_VOL_UP
                          &kp LPAR    &kp RPAR                           
    &kp BSPC    &kp ESC   &kp LBKT    &kp RBKT  &kp ENTER    &kp SPACE   
```

<a name="localbuilds">Local builds</a>
--------------------------------------

While the GitHub method is nice and convenient, it doesn't come without caveats.
One is that I have to be online in order to use it. Another is that it moves my
attention away from my editor and terminal, and that's not good because it
breaks my flow of thinking.

To build local images, install Docker and Colima, start them, then build the
firmware files from the repository directory

```shell
brew install docker colima
colima start --arch aarch64
cd adv360-pro-zmk
make
```

Of course the initial build time is going to be long, since it has to install
everything.

When building has finished and there were no errors, the firmware files will be
available in the `firmware/` directory.

```console
> tree firmware
firmware
├── 202501180513-70c6055-left.uf2
└── 202501180513-70c6055-right.uf2

1 directory, 2 files
```


<a name="closing">Closing remarks</a>
-------------------------------------

The Kinesis Advantage360 Professional is an excellent investment if you use a
keyboard a lot. There have been minor hiccups like having the two parts not
synchronizing with each other after flashing a new firmware, but it is
manageable. Overall, I would say, that the Advantage360 Professional is a
top-tier input device that has secured its own spot in the rich world of
(mechanical) keyboards.

It is currently available on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Advantage360-Professional-Ergonomic-Keyboard/dp/B0BCHMGZMD).
More information about Kinesis and their other products are available on their
[website](https://kinesis-ergo.com/) and [X](https://x.com/kinesisergo).
