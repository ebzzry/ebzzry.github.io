I recently came across an
[interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DLtq6XeF94) of Stephen Cuunjieng
regarding education and economics. Here are my thoughts about it.

Two years ago, I spoke about this topic in AI Asia Expo 2023, in the panel about
Artificial Intelligence and Education. The key to fixing the system is to invest
more time and energy into improving the education system. 

In Information Technology (IT), this is so prevalent. I’ve said this many times
and I will say this again: the use of Generative AI (Gen AI) is erosion of
Common Sense. The moment an educator uses it, they have already waived Critical
Thinking and resigned to Idiocy.

Here’s how it works: The professor uses Gen AI for his lessons and exams. The
students use Gen AI to answer the exams. The professor uses Gen AI to check the
submitted exams. Lather, rinse, repeat. It invariably results to unemployable
nincompoops.

Gen AI systems fail because these systems don’t know what is right or wrong.
This is a classic demonstration of Gödel Incompleteness Theorem. The passionate
promotion for Gen AI is inversely proportional to the knowledge of how they
work.

Interestingly, 99.99% of the people who talk about «Artificial Intelligence»,
including the ones that I know, don’t even have the slightest idea of what it
is. I see them talk in conferences, symposiums, and seminars, but they’re all
pretending to contribute something of value. They’re all just echoing what they
read or watched, online. They get stumped when I ask them basic questions about
CS.

The entire field of Information Technology moves at a rapid pace. Your knowledge
this month, may become obsolete next month. That is the reason why educators are
the bottlenecks. Professors will always be lagging behind industry standards if
they’re not part of the industry, which is usually the case. They’re not
actively engaged in projects, contributing to (open source) software
development, and participating in invention and discovery. What they’re teaching
in schools have no viability outside the institution.

Most of the applicants that I interview for technical positions fail. Within the
first five minutes of the interview, they’ve already demonstrated complete lack
of knowledge of the things they have written in their CVs. Almost 50% of the
applicants use CV generators. The other 50% put fillers—lots and lots of false
information.

Most of what is being taught in school is a tiny subset of what is functional
and usable outside. This, then, creates the illusion of competence and talent.
And of course, educators couldn’t care less about it.

Then we have cybersecurity instructors, who call themselves as experts, who does
not even know how software works. What we have are script kiddies who rely on
tools and services to fake technical competence. These wannabes don’t even know
what bit shifting is.

As long as you’re not implementing it, you don’t understand it. If you’re not
part of the solution, you’re part of the problem.
