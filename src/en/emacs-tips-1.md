<a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
---------------------------------------

I still have to find a better text editor than [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). What
really makes Emacs shine is its configuration language—Emacs Lisp. Emacs uses it to the point that
most of the functionality of Emacs itself, is implemented in Emacs Lisp. In this series, I will talk
about the things that I discovered to make the use of Emacs even more enjoyable.


<a name="regions">Regions</a>
------------------------------

This command deletes a region if one is active, or deletes the character underneath the cursor.

```lisp
(defun delete-char-or-region (&optional arg)
  (interactive "p")
  (if (region-active-p)
      (delete-region (region-beginning)
                     (region-end))
      (if (fboundp 'delete-char)
          (delete-char arg)
          (delete-forward-char arg))))
```


<a name="compilation">Compilation</a>
--------------------------------------

I use this command frequently, and I use it from typesetting LaTeX documents, compiling Scribble
documents, compiling code, and just about anything that I can use make with.

```lisp
(defun compile-file ()
  (interactive)
  (compile "make -k"))
```


<a name="scheme">Scheme</a>
----------------------------

I want to have a command that explicitly saves the input ring of Geiser:

```lisp
(defun geiser-save ()
  (interactive)
  (geiser-repl--write-input-ring))
```

I also have the following, because I want to align the `λ` symbol nicely.

```lisp
(defun my-scheme-mode-hook ()
  (put 'λ 'scheme-indent-function 1))

(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'my-scheme-mode-hook)
```


<a name="server">Server</a>
----------------------------

This snippet ensures that the Emacs server, the one that `emacsclient` connects to, runs:

```lisp
(require 'server)

(unless (server-running-p)
  (server-start))
```

Alternatively, you may run Emacs in daemon mode from the command-line:

```bash
$ emacs --daemon
```


<a name="buffers"><Buffers/a>
------------------------------

I want a way to kill the current buffer, without being asked what buffer to kill. I will only get
prompted if the current has been modified.

```lisp
(defun kill-current-buffer ()
  (interactive)
  (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))
```


<a name="marks">Marks</a>
--------------------------

There have been plenty of times in the past when I needed a function that just marks a line. What I
have is below. Executing it multiple times, marks multiple lines.

```lisp
(defun mark-line (&optional arg)
  (interactive "p")
  (if (not mark-active)
      (progn
        (beginning-of-line)
        (push-mark)
        (setq mark-active t)))
  (forward-line arg))
```


<a name="keybindings">Key bindings</a>
---------------------------------------

The key bindings for the commands above, are listed below:

```lisp
(bind-keys
 :map global-map
 ("<delete>" . delete-char-or-region)
 ("C-x C-k" . kill-current-buffer)
 ("C-x c" . compile-file)
 ("M-z" . mark-line))

(bind-keys
 :map scheme-mode-map
 ("C-c <tab>" . completion-at-point))
```


<a name="closing">Closing remarks</a>
--------------------------------------

I hope you’ll be able to find use of any of them. The rest of the configuration can be
found [here](https://github.com/ebzzry/dotfiles/tree/main/emacs).
