I recently came across an
[interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DLtq6XeF94) of Stephen Cuunjieng
regarding education and economics. Here are my thoughts about it.

Two years ago, I spoke about this topic in AI Asia Expo 2023, in the panel about
Artificial Intelligence and Education. The key to fixing the system is to invest
more time and energy into improving the education system. 

In Information Technology (IT), something is so prevalent and I’ve spoken about
this this topic so many times, and I will say this again: the use of Generative
AI (Gen AI) for learning is erosion of common sense. The moment an educator uses
it, they waive critical thinking and resigned to idiocy.

Here’s how it works: The professor uses Gen AI for his lessons and exams. The
students use Gen AI to answer the exams. The professor uses Gen AI to check the
submitted exams. Lather, rinse, repeat. It invariably results to unemployable
nincompoops. Gen AI systems fail because these systems don’t know what is right
or wrong.  This is a classic demonstration of Gödel Incompleteness Theorem. The
passionate promotion for Gen AI is inversely proportional to the knowledge of
how they work.

If you just want to watch machines talk to machines, then give back responses, and
the machines confirm the feedback, and you stay in that loop, then you’re have
no value as an educator. Why should students still need to pay you, if the
machines are already giving them what they believe they need? All that you’d be
doing is being a middleman, which the student can bypass since they can talk
directly to these systems. 

Interestingly, 99.99% of the people who talk about «Artificial Intelligence»,
including the ones that I know, don’t even have the slightest idea of what it
is. I see them talk in conferences, symposiums, and seminars, but they’re all
pretending to contribute something of value. They’re all just echoing what they
read or watched, online. They get stumped when I ask them basic questions about
CS.

The entire field of Information Technology moves at a rapid pace. Your knowledge
this month, may become obsolete next month. That is the reason why educators are
the bottlenecks. Professors will always be lagging behind industry standards if
they’re not part of the industry, which is usually the case. They’re not
actively engaged in projects, contributing to (open source) software
development, and participating in invention and discovery. What they’re teaching
in schools have no viability outside the institution.

Most of the applicants that I interview for technical positions fail. Within the
first five minutes of the interview, they’ve already demonstrated complete lack
of knowledge of the things they have written in their CVs. Almost 50% of the
applicants use CV generators. The other 50% put fillers—lots and lots of false
information.

Most of what is being taught in school is a tiny subset of what is functional
and usable outside. This, then, creates the illusion of competence and talent.
And of course, educators couldn’t care less about it. As long as you’re not
implementing it, you don’t understand it. If you’re not part of the solution,
you’re part of the problem.

To make things worse, there are clowns everywhere that have popped up like
mushrooms. What they do is talk endlessly about artificial intelligence
governance, policies, regulations, alignment, assessment, readiness. Seriously?
I can’t understand why they have the audacity to talk in front of crowds
carrying with them serious faces of pseudo-competence. Artificial intelligence
is the compound of the scientific research, the engineering, the tools, the
community, and the economy. You can’t treat it like physical commodity found in
the supermarket. Of course, the truth is that they lobby policies so that they
secure seats of power to control the industry, more than the facade of seminars
and conventions.

There are no shortcuts to learning. You still have to pour in the hundreds, if
not thousands of hours, in order to get better. If you want to be able to lift
that heavy barbell, you have to train to lift it. You have take a special
program that will allow you to progressively lift weights, until you reach your
goal. Having somebody lift the weights for you will never make you stronger. No
amount of training by others, for you, will increase your muscular strength.
