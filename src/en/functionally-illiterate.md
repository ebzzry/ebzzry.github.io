<a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
---------------------------------------

I recently came across an
[interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DLtq6XeF94) of Stephen Cuunjieng
regarding education and economics. Here are my thoughts about it.

-------------------------------

If the plumbing system is not working, do you blame the electricians?

Countless times have I heard that the problem of functional illiteracy is mostly
prevalent with the public education system. I beg to disagree. Unfortunately, it
is present in both the public and private sectors. The distribution is slightly
towards the former, but both share significant parts of the pie.

Why are you all so afraid to point out the real issues here? Why are you all so
hesitant to accept what’s the real cause of the issue. Why do you like to shift
blame to other parts of the society just to exonerate the group that is at the
heart of the issue. Why do you like to avoid the truth. I’ve been vocal about
this topic for a very long time and by observations have been consistent.

First is the (absence of) money. People say that it’s the lack of proper budget
that disables the education systems. However, it has been observed that even if
you have a great incentives program, even if you increase the salaries, the
problem is still there. When more learning resources are made available, like
modern computers and big OLED screens, the problem is still there? At worst are
low-income places with high educational statistics? So, how come?

Next is (incompetent) students. It’s often made the case that it’s their fault
for not learning; that they’re slow and incompetent; that they can’t catch up;
and that they are not equipped to learn new things. Then why is it the case that
you have really bright students who are supposed to excel with their favorite
subjects, still fail in those subjects themselves? These same students make
great progress outside the classrooms. They even pursue personal projects, at
home. At worst, are students that have learning disabilities but still excel
later in life? So, how come?

Next is the (incompetent) government. It’s already the classic trope that
everyone should blame the government when anything fails. The problem is that we
all are part of the government. We are all responsible for this. Why is it that
even with an abundance of government projects—funding, classrooms, schools,
books—the results are still the same? At worst, they don’t give any support to
the schools? How come?

Next is (incompetent) school adminstrators and directors. They’re often blamed
for not creating the right school programs that would promote higher levels of
educational and teaching competence. They would always cater to the demands and
needs of their subordinates. They would send their staff to attend seminars and
lectures to learn things that would elevate their profession. At worst, are
school administrator would would just sit in their offices doing practically
nothing. So, how come?

The real issue is (incompetent) teachers. They are the bottlenecks.
Was, is, and will always be. So, you build a house that has the following:
structural system, electrical system, phone system, and the plumbing system.
When you have a leaking pipe, do you blame the structural system that was in
charge of setting up the main pillars of the house? Do you blame the electrical
system, that was in charge of wiring down the house? Do you blame the phone
system, that was responsible in installing communication lines? Or do you blame
the plumbing system that was in charge of installing the water pipes?

Yes, some areas can contribute to the cause of the problem. The phone system can
be blamed because nobody can use the phone when the leak started to appear. The
electrical system can be blamed because a short-circuit in a room triggered a small
fire, that triggered the sprinkler. The structural system can be blamed because
a wall had corrosion issues that led to the corrosion of some water pipes. Even
with all the areas combined, it will still not contribute to more than 20% of
the cause of the problem, that there is a faulty pipe system.

The teachers are the ones directly interacting with students to teach them
things that they do not know, that they should know, and things that they should
improve on. The teachers are the ones in charge of the lessons plans. They are
the ones who have first hand knowledge of the topics. It’s not the school
administration. It’s not the school directors. Those two groups can only do so
much, because at the end of the day it’s still the technical competence of the
teachers that will have the most amount of influence to the students.

The problem is seeing teaching only as a profession. It is not seen as an end it
itself. It is seen just as a means to an end. It just regarded by most as just a
way to make to ends meet; to pay the bills. Ironically, the teaching that most
teachers do, does not happen outside classrooms.

When you have teachers that do not know anything about the subjects that they
are teaching, you have a system that is broken from the inside. Before they even
get their licenses to teach, they were already failing. Long before they leave
the walls of the universities, they’re already well on their way of not doing
anything. When you have teachers who don’t have a deep relationship with
knowledge and teaching, you have a rotten core.

If you’ll always have to wait for the government to do something, then you miss
the point. If you’ll always play the blame game, and point your fingers at the
public officials and wait for their support, then by effect, you’ve disabled the
generations that you could have supported and uplifted. The best works in
science, engineering, literature, and artwork didn’t wait for the government to
do something, first.

-------------------------------

At the risk of sounding repetitive and I will say it again: the use of
Generative AI (Gen AI) for learning is erosion of common sense. The moment an
educator uses it, they waive critical thinking and resigned to idiocy.

Here’s how it works: The professor uses Gen AI for his lessons and exams. The
students use Gen AI to answer the exams. The professor uses Gen AI to check the
submitted exams. Lather, rinse, repeat. It invariably results to unemployable
nincompoops. Gen AI systems fail because these systems don’t know what is right
or wrong.  This is a classic demonstration of Gödel Incompleteness Theorem. The
passionate promotion for Gen AI is inversely proportional to the knowledge of
how they work.

If you just want to watch machines talk to machines, then give back responses, and
the machines confirm the feedback, and you stay in that loop, then you’re have
no value as an educator. Why should students still need to pay you, if the
machines are already giving them what they believe they need? All that you’d be
doing is being a middleman, which the student can bypass since they can talk
directly to these systems. 

The entire field of Information Technology moves at a rapid pace. Your knowledge
this month, may become obsolete next month. That is the reason why educators are
the bottlenecks. Professors will always be lagging behind industry standards if
they’re not part of the industry, which is usually the case. They’re not
actively engaged in projects, contributing to (open source) software
development, and participating in invention and discovery. What they’re teaching
in schools have no viability outside the institution.

Most of the applicants that I interview for technical positions fail. Within the
first five minutes of the interview, they’ve already demonstrated complete lack
of knowledge of the things they have written in their CVs. Almost 50% of the
applicants use CV generators. The other 50% put fillers—lots and lots of false
information.

Most of what is being taught in school is a tiny subset of what is functional
and usable outside. This, then, creates the illusion of competence and talent.
And of course, educators couldn’t care less about it. As long as you’re not
implementing it, you don’t understand it. If you’re not part of the solution,
you’re part of the problem.

To make things worse, there are clowns everywhere that have popped up like
mushrooms. What they do is talk endlessly about artificial intelligence
governance, policies, regulations, alignment, assessment, readiness. Seriously?
I can’t understand why they have the audacity to talk in front of crowds
carrying with them serious faces of pseudo-competence. Artificial intelligence
is the compound of the scientific research, the engineering, the tools, the
community, and the economy. You can’t treat it like physical commodity found in
the supermarket. Of course, the truth is that they lobby policies so that they
secure seats of power to control the industry, more than the facade of seminars
and conventions.

-------------------------------------

There are no shortcuts to learning. You still have to pour in the hundreds, if
not thousands of hours, in order to get better. If you want to be able to lift
that heavy barbell, you have to train to lift it. You have take a special
program that will allow you to progressively lift weights, until you reach your
goal. Having somebody lift the weights for you will never make you stronger. No
amount of training by others, for you, will increase your muscular strength.

When you have a culture that embraces beauty pageants; noontime shows; singing
and dancing competitions; more than science, mathematics, language, and
philosophy; you have a system that is bound to fail. When you have a culture
that worships
[anti-intellectualism](https://maniladialecticsociety.substack.com/p/filipino-anti-intellectualism-a-symptom)
instead of supporting those who promote genuine learning, you have a system that
is weak. When you have a culture that is so eager to see the next barangay
basketball tournament instead of organizing donation drives for books and
learning resources, you have a system that is illiterate.
