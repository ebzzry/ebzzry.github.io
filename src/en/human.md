<a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
---------------------------------------

We take communication for granted. Just because you can speak does not mean that you can
communicate. Everyday, we use whatever media is available to convey ideas, messages, and absurdities
to one another. However, we don’t really bother to put attention to how we communicate. As long as
what we’re asking is simply answered, we’re satisfied. That should change.

Effective communication happens when a message is conveyed as a means to reach a desired
goal. Due to its goal-based approach, it doesn’t matter if the communicator communicated more than what
he intended. When you use a tank to kill a single mosquito, it is effective.

Efficient communication happens when the exact amount of message is conveyed—no more; no less. An
example is when someone gives accurate instructions to someone to do something, to a tee. This does
not leave room for errors on the communicate.

Frigid communication happens when cold manners of speaking are used. It carries the psychopathic
methods of contemporary textbooks about communication. In a corporate or business setting, it is far
too common to see everyone communicating to one another like rabid hyenae in a steel cage—sterile
and without compassion.

In this article, I’m going to discuss how to approach communication in a human way. How is human
communication different from other methods?


<a name="spoken"></a>Spoken language
------------------------------------

We learned how to speak first, before we learned how to write; this speaks a lot about how
primordial verbal communication is. This comes at a price, though: it is both easy to use and
misuse. When someone gives you a compliment, that impression lasts for a long time. When someone
says hurtful words, we carry it for the rest of our lives.


### <a name="humans">Humans, not machines</a>

When we communicate with machines—whether they are in software or hardware form—we must make
accurate correspondence between what our intentions are and what outputs we desire from those inputs
will be. The interactions and the results of which, are computable and predictable.

Human beings are vastly different—there is no 1:1 correspondence of instructions and
outcomes. Humans are emotional animals. We have evolved from very different circumstances compared
to modern computing systems that we have now. When we communicate messages that are exact, we don’t
take into account several factors including the variability of interpretation. Just because we
clearly understand what we are saying does not mean that the other side of the communication
understands it as well as we do. Were we able to sufficiently provide enough background and context
to the communicate? Were we able to accurately transfer our mental image of the ideas to the
listener? Is he able to construct my thought processes as accurately as I want it to be? If just one
of those questions is answered by a no, then we need to reassess how are we communicating.


### <a name="limitations">Accept limitations</a>

When one needs to communicate messages to someone that do not possess the same mental faculties as
the communicator, adjustments have to be made. Every one of us process things differently. A chess
grandmaster should bear in mind that when he is teaching a beginner, the student can only understand
so much. They can’t go ham and make them understand advanced topics. There is an impregnable wall; that
wall only becomes thin with time.


### <a name="tolerant">Be tolerant</a>

It is relatively easy to fall into a trap wherein our emotions would like to take charge of our
communication processes. When we think that what we are communicating is not being assimilated well
by the communicate, we become frustrated and intolerant. When it happens, we push our ideas even
harder down the avenue, which further exacerbates the already-dysfunctional communication. When we
lack patience, we no longer understand why are we even communicating in the first place.


<a name="written">Written language</a>
--------------------------------------

Several advancements in writing have been realized for the past decades. We went from handwritten
content to computer-driven ones. However, even with all the conveniences of writing, we are still
susceptible to not being able to clearly send our messages to our recipients. Written, unlike
spoken language is a different beast altogether.


### <a name="courteous">Be courteous</a>

What’s the difference between _“Read the documents.”_ and _“Please, read the documents.”_? When the
proper words are used, we positively visualize, we imagine in our heads how would the communication
take place had it been done on a face-to-face basis. Conversely, when we use words in excess, it
creates a strain on the message, completely altering the content. Compare _“Go.”_ with _“Go. WTF.”_


### <a name="emojis">Use emojis sparingly</a>

One downside of written communication is that it is very difficult to express emotions, that you
want to show. There are occasions when no matter how good the words are, it is still not able to
attach our warmth and sincerity to the message. A lot of times, an emoji conveys a message that is
uniform across cultures. The image of a happy face conveys the message of a person who exhibits
happiness. Humans are able to identify with that image, with ease. But, just like with perfumes, too
much is bad.


### <a name="exclamation">Use the exclamation point, instead of the period</a>

The punctuation marks what we use in our messages matter, a lot, whether they are short phrases or
complete sentences. This, again, is connected to the way we envision the person who is communicating
the messages. Let’s take for example the reply _“Got it.”_ This short message is concise and clear.
However, it is also devoid of life; it lacks zest. Compare this with _“Got it!”_ This version is
alive. It creates a mental image of a person who is committed and engaged with the conversation.


<a name="body">Body language</a>
--------------------------------

When our physical bodies convey messages that are not congruent to what we are speaking, an
imbalance occurs. This creates confusion, and sometimes, frustration. If our speech is the sound
that comes out of our mouths, our bodies are our shells. Without a stable shell, our messages get
lost.


### <a name="lean">Lean forward</a>

Consider this: as you are communicating with someone, they move their body away from you. What message
does it send you? Compare this with someone, who leans forward to listen to you. What happened is
that the mere act of moving forward reduces the distance between the origin of the sound—his mouth,
to the destination of the sound—your ears. In terms of the speed at which sound travels on average
on air, this distance is negligible. However, it means a lot to the one who is speaking. You
signal to them that you are committed to receiving their messages. You show that you are actively
participating in the conversation.


### <a name="palms">Display open palms</a>

When we display our palms to the listener, we invoke a sense of participation. One that shows that
the one with open palms makes themself vulnerable. This is due in part to our anatomy—our palms are
fleshly and sensitive. If the inside of our hands are wounded, our ability to hold and grip things
are greatly compromised. When we display our palms, we display openness, we display willingness to
learn, we display trust.


### <a name="eyes">Look at the eyes, but do not stare</a>

In face-to-face interactions, nothing is more powerful and subtle than eye contact. Even if no words
are uttered, messages are communicated. When someone is speaking to you, maintain eye contact. The
trick is not to look directly at the eyes, but somewhere between the bridge, or just a centimeter
around the line where the eyebrows meet. To make it more engaging, briefly look on the sides, or
downwards, then go back to the eye area. Do not, however, look at other parts of a person’s body
during this process—it may signal to them that you are not paying attention to what he is saying.


<a name="miscellany">Miscellany</a>
-----------------------------------

There are some things that don’t fit in the categories above, and I’ve collected them here
instead.


### <a name="adapt">Adapt to every person</a>

Do not take a one-size-fits-all approach. Just because your usual method works with
another person, doesn’t mean it is right for another. Or, just because you are so used with the
communication methods that you use on a daily basis with people that you interact with daily,
doesn’t mean that you should use them everywhere. Don’t use your wood saw with iron bars. Understand
what makes a person tick. Know their interests. Do not underestimate the power of small talk.


### <a name="listen">Listen more</a>

No matter how good we think we are, we need to listen to whoever is communicating with
us. Otherwise, why engage in a communication at all, if we are so busy with our hubris that we only
want our voices to be heard? Control the urge to interrupt. Don’t hijack the conversation. The more
willing you show that you want to listen, the more people will want to talk to you.


### <a name="smile">Smile</a>

The payload of a smile is not at the instant that the smile was received; it is during our moments
of reflection. A smile creates a lasting impact, and it is so potent that it is able to alter an
ill perception. A smile conveys lightheartedness, engagement, and happiness. Wear it. Own it. 😄
