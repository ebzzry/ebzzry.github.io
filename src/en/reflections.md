This page contains contains some of my personal reflections. Entries are sorted
in chronological order.


- While the intrepid ones are braving the storms with courage and triumph, the
  cowards are basking in the shores of submission and conformity.<br>


- Curiosity is the enemy of ignorance, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.<br>


- Golden opportunities are often missed because they are cloaked with dirty
  garment, rather than with glitter and gold.<br>


- When you don’t give your best, and unfavorable results come out, you’ll wonder
  what would have happened had you done your finest.<br>


- Challenge. Persist. Conquer.<br>


- Unless we will have the boldness and audacity to drive them away, our greatest
  fears will not leave us. If, however, they are there to stay, then we should
  have the strength and courage to tame them.<br>


- If your ship doesn’t come to you, swim to it; if you can’t swim, have the ship
  towed to you.<br>


- Smile, even in the face of adversary, for that will also be the time that
  you’ll embrace victory.<br>


- If you want to create the future, focus on the moment rather than the
  outcome.<br>


- You answers, no matter how confident you are with them, are incorrect, if they
  were for the wrong questions.<br>


- If you can’t beat them, arrange to have them beaten.<br>


- Procrastinate procrastination.<br>


- Defer to use what you will use to defer.<br>


- Work your way through things, not around it.<br>


- Irrationality is a choice.<br>


- Stand out, then blend in.<br>


- Even stars die.<br>


- Impatience is the twin of impulsiveness.<br>


- Opinions are biases.<br>


- A nation is only as strong as its weakest peoples.<br>


- We think that we know.<br>


- When the rules change, adapt. If you can’t nor want to adapt, change the
  rules.<br>


- Diplomacy as a result of non-choice is no diplomacy at all.<br>


- If you can’t join them, beat them.<br>


- With great power comes great irresponsibility.<br>


- Never attribute to malice what incompetence will explain. Never attribute to
  incompetence what nature will explain.<br>


- Choices are illusions; there are only circumstances.<br>


- Take care of your shell, because it’s the only one that you have.<br>


- In the grand scale of the universe, human lives are insignificant. We are
  selfish with our lives because they are our own. However, we should remind
  ourselves, that for life to flourish, there must also be death.<br>


- Tell me what you care about, and I’ll tell you who you are.<br>


- The form of a question determines the form of the answer.<br>


- Power without control is nil; control without power is nil.<br>


- A true master knows that he’ll never become one.<br>


- One of the most satisfying yet most difficult thing to learn, is how to
  unlearn.<br>


- People gossip about other people because their own lives are too
  uninteresting.<br>


- However less you use social networking, use lesser.<br>


- The most difficult lies to detect are the ones that are mixed with the
  truths.<br>


- Humans have the amazing ability to resist invention, progress, and innovation.
  They frequently advertise their ability to mold and change themselves. The
  truth, however, is that those are mere projections of what they want to
  achieve, not what they have.<br>


- We get so hung up in goals, when the only the real tangible goal in life, is
  death.<br>


- If you were told that you are eventually going to die, will you still want to
  live?<br>


- Relationships, unlike wars, are not battles. We give back, we take in, we fall
  in love, we get hurt, we love again. Nothing is definite. We don’t know what
  happens next. But nothing will happen, if we do nothing.<br>


- We didn’t have the option whether to board the ship or not. We just find
  ourselves, in the middle of the journey, after the ship has already left the
  port.<br>


- The only thing that binds us to our loved ones are our memories.<br>


- The more I err, the more I become right.<br>


- What I do not understand, I rewrite.<br>


- Whatever you do, never be afraid.<br>

- Let’s not fear pain, because feeling pain is one of the best ways to become
  stronger.<br>


- In the face of the cosmos, we all are children forever.<br>

  stronger.<br>

  future.<br>


- Everything and nothing matters. Meaning is our invention. It is an attempt to
  quantify, qualify, and justify our perceived existence.<br>

  discovering more problems.<br>


- We can’t solve those which we think does not need solving.<br>


- Social networking is an animal that you must not tame.<br>


- Never underestimate physical forces.<br>


- The universe does not have an obligation to mean anything to us. Since the
  beginning of time, it was always us, who wanted to give meaning to
  everything.<br>


- The most important things to consider when creating a universe from nothing
  are the initial conditions. Everything depends on it.<br>


- The definition of life is blurry—a black hole is as alive as a bacteria. The
  attributes of life which we have given to it, strongly depends on our
  relationship to the life forms that we are acquainted with.<br>

  entertainment.<br>

  inclinations to believe that it indeed exists.<br>


- Demonstration of intelligence does not imply intelligence.<br>

  they deserve it.<br>


- My body is my shell. My mind is my playground.<br>

- You can’t teach a chicken how to shoot, because it can’t.<br>


- Doubt; always doubt.<br>


- One of the things that continually disturbs me is, that I am ignorant of many
  things. Additionally, of all those things, I am most ignorant of reality.<br>


- It is futile to think how you can fly like a falcon if you are an orca.
  Instead, it is far better to aim how you can become a stronger orca.<br>


- In a noisy room, if you want to be heard, wait for the moment wherein everyone
  has stopped talking. Then, speak. Then, one becomes heard.<br>

  more unable to forgive.<br>


- It doesn’t matter what evil the world has done to you. What matters is what
  good you’ll give to it.<br>

  thing that was lost.<br>

- Just dive and try not to drown.<br>


- The question of whether machines can think is a question of whether submarines
  can swim.<br>


- One of the main problems with determing what reality is first defining what is
  real. For all intents and purposes we can settle on an arbitrary level and say
  that that is real. Who or what is the arbiter in confirming to us whether our
  beliefs are true or not.<br>


- One of the key problems with knowing what reality is, is first finding the
  definition of the word “real.”<br>

- In capitalism, the good players are rewarded. In socialism and communism, it
  doesn’t matter how good you are.<br>

  anything. What’s bad for one can be good for another. In order to have
  moderation, there must be rules which can possibly favor one side over the
  other.<br>


- Some people like to play basketball while some people like to play volleyball.
  And that is fine. However, problems appear when all players want to play in
  the same place at the same time.<br>


- My greatest fear was seeing myself in the mirror. I always feared, that
  whatever is going be seen is not going to be pleasant. Well, I was right.
  There was indeed a horrifying image. But, not anymore effective today.<br>


- Would airplanes fly that fast if they flew like birds? Does humanity need to
  imitate it? Did humanity wait for the bird wing technology before deciding to
  fly humans?<br>
