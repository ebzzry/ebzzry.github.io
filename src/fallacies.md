A Fallacies Primer
==================

<center>May 1, 2016</center>

Fallacies are errors in reasoning, made in the construction of
arguments. Some are committed intentionally to manipulate and deceive,
while some are committed unintentionally due to ignorance. Fallacies
are divided into two kinds—formal and informal. Formal fallacies, also
called logical fallacies, are expressed in a system like propositional
logic. Informal fallacies are errors in the content of the premises.

In this post I’ll briefly go through some of the common fallacies
encountered in our daily lives. Some are hidden in plain sight while
some creep into the corners and require a closer examination.


## Post hoc ergo propter hoc

After X, Y happened. Therefore, X caused Y. When an event happened
after another event, it is presumed that what happened before it must
have caused it.

> “After Juana communed to Jibbers Crabst, her father recovered from
> his illness. Praise Jibbers Crabst!”

This is fallacious because she ignores the possibility that it may
have been the medications given to her father, that made him well.


## Cum hoc ergo propter hoc

During X, Y happened. Therefore, X is related Y. When an event happened
together with another event, it is presumed that what happened with it
must be relevant.

> “Oh my! Did you know that when I was moving here to New York, Cubao,
> Pedro was doing so, too! Our minds must be connected by astral
> forces!”

This is fallacious because she doesn’t consider other factors like
Pedro moving to that city because of his own volition, and not due to
magic.


## Ad hominem

This happens when instead of presenting a case against an argument,
person A is instead attacked personally, by person B. This is done to
discredit the person A, based on who he is, and not the argument that
he holds.

> After Maria presented a compelling evidence on the failures of
> democracy, Juan objected that we shouldn’t believe anything from a
> woman who isn’t married, doesn’t have kids, and listens to weird
> music.

Maria’s personal status doesn’t not have any bearing on the validity
her claims. Juan’s statements are irrelevant. What should be attacked
are Maria’s argument, and not her personal standings.


## Tu quoque

This is committed when a person’s argument are claimed to be false
because that person is inconsistent with his words. This fallacy is
also known as the “You, too” fallacy.

> Doctor: “Quit smoking because it is harmful to your health.”<br>
> Patient: “You, yourself smoke, so I can’t follow your advice.”

The patient rendered Maria’s statement to be invalid, because Maria
smokes. If the patient presented an objection that smoking is *not*
harmful to the health, then it would have been a better position.


## Loaded question

This happens when a presumption is made beforehand, and that an answer
is forced from constrained choices, like a “yes” or a “no”.

> “Juan, have you stopped cheating on your wife?”

This is fallacious because the speaker assumes that Juan has cheated,
at least once on his wife. If Juan answers “Yes”, then he has cheated
on his wife before, and that he has already stopped. If Juan answers
“No”, then he has cheated before, and still continues to cheat on her.


## False dichotomy

This is committed when a person is forced to choose a position, or
answer a question, with coerced limits. This is also called the
black-and-white, or the either-or fallacy.

> “Either you’re a theist or an atheist.”

This is fallacious because it presents extreme positions, even if
there are other positions aside from those presented. In this case,
the person being asked may be an agnostic.


## Hasty generalization

This is committed when it is assumed that a part composes the
whole. It is made when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is
not large enough.

> “I was molested in childhood by a homosexual. Thus, all homosexuals
> are vile creatures, and they must be punished!”

The speaker assumed that just because he experienced one such incident
in his life before, he concluded that all homosexuals molest children,
and that must be treated with contempt and disgust.


## Sweeping generalization

This is committed when a majority is assumed to compose the whole. It
is made when a significant percentage is applied to the entire
composition.

> “In all of the stores that I’ve gone to, there’s not a single one
> that sells a blue-tipped Super Panda pen. That means, I won’t be
> able to find such a pen in the whole country.”

The speaker has given up the possibility that such a pen may exist, in
one or more of the stores that he hasn’t visited, yet.


## Burden of proof

This is committed when the responsibility to provide proof does not
lie with person A, the one making claims, but with person B, to
disprove the claims of person A.

> “Since you can’t prove the inexistence of a large cockroach that
> defecates stars, that lives exactly 100,000 light-years away from
> where I’m facing right now, then it must exist.”

Instead of providing evidence to his own claims, person A shifts the
burden of providing proof to person B. Since there are no physical
ways for person B to prove that the claims of person A is invalid,
person A presumes that his claims must be true.


## Slippery slope

This is committed when something is presumed to happen next, due to
another factor. That, if you allow X to happen, Y will follow
suit. Therefore, X should not happen.

> “If we ban the use of firearms for civilians, then crime rate will
> increase because there’ll be nothing that civilians can use to
> protect themselves.”

This fails to consider that majority of gun-related accidents happen
in the homes of their own owners. This also assumes that civilians who
own guns are responsible enough to wield such weapons.


## Red herring

This is committed when an irrelevant topic is introduced to divert
attention from the original argument. The “red herring” is injected,
under the pretense that it is relevant to the original topic.

> Woman: “How do you plan addressing the issues about corruption?”<br>
> Candidate: “I’m going to give everyone a job, and I’m going to lower
> income taxes.”

The goal is to abandon the original topic, to distract the
listener. This is frequently observed in political interviews and
discussions.


## Straw man

This is committed when person B presents a distorted, weaker version
of the argument that person A holds. Person B then attacks this weaker
version, and if triumphant, concludes that person A’s argument is
defeated.

> Juan: “Alcohol ads should be banned from mass media, because it
> encourages underage drinking.”<br>
> Pedro: “People have been drinking alcohol for a long time. They
> will continue to do so.”

Pedro misrepresents the position of Juan as: “People should give up
drinking alcohol.” That is not what Juan said.


## Appeal to age

This is committed when it is argued that very old or very young
arguments are superior. This is frequently seen in marketing and
advertising.

> “Our new and improved Super Bubbly Detergent Zet washes stain off
> better than the leading products.”

This fails to address why their products are superior to the
others. Just because something is old or new, doesn’t make it better.


## Appeal to seniority

This is committed when a person’s age is used to support the validity
of his claims. This is usually applied against someone who is younger.

> “I’ve been in the business for 30 years. You’re only 34, what do you
> know about language design.”

It is assumed here, that just because someone is younger than him,
makes him less qualified for the things that are being discussed.


## Appeal to authority

This is committed when the actions, choices, and words of a person of
authority, or expertise, is used to disprove the claims of another
person.

> “The theory of evolution is wrong, because Kulas, who is a scientist
> said that he doesn’t believe in it.”

Just because someone is a scientist, doesn’t mean that he supports the
[theory of evolution](http://notjustatheory.com/). It is likely that
even if he is a scientist, he doesn’t understand the theory of
evolution.


## Appeal to anonymous authority

This is committed when an appeal to authority is made, but the
authority is not named. This makes it very difficult to verify the
validity of the claims.

> “Experts agree that drinking a glass of Super Juice everyday will
> make you healthier.”

This fails because of the failure to specify who these so-called
“experts” are.


## Appeal to false authority

This is committed when an appeal to authority is made, but the
authority in question is outside the scope of his expertise.

> “Pedro extensively studied and reviewed the efficacy of Liverdead
> capsules, and asserted that they indeed improve liver health.”

Pedro, however, is not qualified professional to study and review
health products, nor does he have any substantial experience prior to
conducting such a study.


## Appeal to popularity

This fallacy states that if most people—relative to the
speaker—chooses a specific position, then that position must be
true. The basic idea is that a claim must be accepted as true on the
grounds that people are favorable towards that claim.

> “The survey shows that most people are going to vote Juan for
> president. Their choice must be correct. I’m going to vote for him,
> too.”

This happens when a person believes a claim on superficial bases. This
usually happens due to biases. A choice is made not due to technical
merits, but due to prejudices.


## Appeal to nature

This fallacy is committed when it is argued that just because
something is “natural” means it is good.

> “Juana claims that if a product is not labeled ‘organic’ or
> ‘natural’, then it is not ideal for consumption.”

[Cultivated tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_tabacum)
(*Nicotiana tabacum*) is a plant that is responsible for more than
five million deaths per year, around the world.


## Appeal to emotion

This fallacy is committed when emotions are used to elicit a
fallacious response from the target. The basic idea is that emotional
tactics are used to persuade a person into believing that the argument
being presented is valid.

> “Pedrito, eat your broccoli. Think about all the poor, starving, and
> homeless children around the world who are unfortunate to even
> eat three times a day.”

Pedrito’s parent wants to make him eat the broccoli, by using
emotional ploy, instead of providing substantial reasons for Pedrito
to eat the broccoli.


## Appeal to force

This fallacy is committed when the threat of force or violence is used
to coerce a person to accept a claim to be true. This fallacy is very
common in religious circles.

> “If you don’t listen to the words of Jibbers Crabst, you’ll burn in
> the torturous flames of Kell.”

Instead of providing a reason why someone should listen to Jibbers
Crabst, threats of violence are instead used to force someone to
follow blindly.


## Appeal to tradition

This fallacy is committed when it is argued that just because
something is traditional, or the norm, then it must be followed. This
is found in religion and cultures.

> “It is customary for us to participate annually in the Kabobohan
> March. You should join us, too.”

This fails to state why one should join the said event. Instead it is
argued that it should be done on the grounds that it is traditional.


## Begging the question

This fallacy is committed when the thing to be proved is used as one
of the premises. It is an example of circular reasoning.

> “The divine words of Jibbers Crabst are pure, splendid, and
> impeccable because it says so in The Eternal and Transcendent Book
> of Crabst.”

This blatantly assumes the validity of the existence of such an
entity, and to prove it means to assume that that entity exists,
first. X because X.


## Selective observation

This is committed when a conclusion is made from narrow and limited
views. This is also called the cherry picking fallacy. Mass and social
media is notorious of this.

> “Juana is living a happy and satisfying life because I frequently
> see her posts on Facebook that she is happy.”

The observer ignores the possibility that what he sees may not be true
because Juana only posts what she wants people to see and believe.


## No true Scotsman

This is committed when an argument is made by asserting that a
behavior is only acceptable within the confines of certain standards.

> “Why don’t you eat with your bare hands? A true Dodoman should eat with
> his bare hands!”

This is a form of false purity. It asserts that there is one
acceptable way for a Dodoman to eat. This is similar to appeal to
tradition.
