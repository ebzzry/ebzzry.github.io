This post is my attempt to do just that, only that the grandmother
here is myself. I firmly believe that unless I try to explain
something, will I really understand it. This post takes a very
laid-back approach, and avoids very technical topics, unless
warranted.

## Introduction

### What is it?

Lambda calculus is a minimal system for expressing computation that
conforms to universal models of computation, hence making it a
universal model of computation. In other words, it can be called as
one of simplest programming languages, only that it looks and behaves
differently from the ones we contemporarily know. Lambda calculus also
forms as the basis for the popular functional programming languages in
current use now.


### Do I need to learn it?

Yes, and no. If you want to understand the underlying mechanisms of
how software works, or if you want to build the next great language,
or if you just want to appreciate the elegance of its art, then
yes. However, if you just want to fly a plane without knowing how it
ticks, then no. Seriously though, learn it.


### What do we do?

When discussing new concepts, it is very important to layout the
axioms or the initial ruleset. Think of it as defining new terms in
play, and giving them meaning. The context in which these meanings
live are important. For example, for the gardener the hose is used to
water the plans, while for the fireman, the hose is used to put out
the fire. When the gardener, or the fireman grabs the hose, he will
not question what is that he is holding, and what is its purpose. He
simply believes in his faith of intuition, to determine the meaning of
the hose at the time he grabbed it.

In English, the word “high” has specific meanings. But for all the
defined meanings of the word, there is no intrinsic knowledge of the
value of the word. We take the meaning as is. We have to agree to use
the word in the narrowed context of the users of the word. If we try
to deviate from the established meaning of the word, for example, we
randomly create a new definition of the word because of whim, chances
are it won’t be accepted. We need to believe in the defined
connotative and denotative meanings of the word, for it to have
meaning to us. The same holds true for lambda calculus — we either
accept these axioms and operate in its domain, or we live in
Neverland.


## Baby steps

### Functions

A central player in lambda calculus is the notion of function. Most of
us are familiar with functions in our high-level languages, but
functions in lambda calculus are slightly different — they need to
have at the minimum a single parameter. In most production languages
in use now, you can invoke a function that doesn’t take an
argument. They’re usually used for side-effects. In lambda calculus,
however, a bare minimum of one argument is enforced. Here’s what a
minimal function in lambda calculus looks like:

```
λx.x
```

Which is equivalent to:

```
(λz.z)
(λc.c)
```

This equivalence is called the α-conversion. The names do not matter, as
long as they’re used consistently. Parentheses may be used to remove
ambiguity when applying functions. The function above is equivalent to:

```
(λx.x)
```

The Greek letter `λ` denotes that the surrounding context is a
function — or something that can be applied or used. The `λ` symbol
is used instead of another symbol because of a typesetting issue that
is discussed
[here](http://www.users.waitrose.com/~hindley/SomePapers_PDFs/2006CarHin,HistlamRp.pdf). So,
don’t fret too much about, just use it.

What comes next after the `λ` symbol, before the `.`, is the
parameter. Technically, it can be any symbol. It simply means the name
that can be used when applying that function, to refer to its
argument.

The `.` symbol here, is the separator between the parameter list,
and the function body. In the function `(λx.x)`, the body is simply
the symbol `x`.

### Variables

In lambda calculus, the symbols that are used inside a function are
called variables. Going back to the function you defined above,

```
(λx.x)
```

The parameter `x` is a variable that is said to be bound, because it
sandwiched between `λ` and `.`. However, in the function:

```
(λx.xy)
```

The parameter `y` is a variable that is said to be free, because it
does not live between `λ` and `.`.

### Function application

To use a function, you must apply it to something. The bound variables
are substituted with what they’re applied to — a process called
β-reduction.

For example:

```
(λx.x)y
y
```

Let’s break it down:

1. Apply `(λx.x)` to `y`:
2. Consume the arguments, then substitute all instances `x` in the
   body, with `y`.

“Wait, it merely returned the argument y.” you may say. That is
true. The function `(λx.x)` is the identity function — it is a
single-parameter function that returns whatever is was applied to.

Functions are not limited to be applied to symbols. They can also be
applied to other functions:

```
(λx.x)(λy.y)
(λy.y)
```

In the example above, the identify function is applied to an identity
function, returning an identity function.

Here’s another application involving free variables:

```
(λa.ab)(λy.y)
(λy.y)b
b
```

The bound variable `a` was substituted with `(λy.y)`, which is then
applied to the free variable `b`, resulting to `b`.

Take note that this function application:

```
(λx.(λy.y))ab
(λy.y)b
b
```

is equivalent to:

```
(λxy.y)ab
b
```

Having multiple parameter names is a shorthand to multiple lambdas,
giving the abbreviated version the impression that it consumes
multiple arguments at once.

Inside the body of a function, when two symbols are adjacent to one
another, the first symbol is presumed to be a function being applied
to the second symbol, minus the parentheses. For example, the
following code:

```
(λxy.xy)
```

is equivalent to:

```
(λxy.x(y))
```


## Let’s count!

### Start

Since (almost) everything in lambda calculus is expressed as
functions, its take on numbers is unique. Arguably, the most important
number in lambda calculus is zero (0), which is expressed as:

```
(λsz.z)
```

For convenience purposes, let’s label that expression as `0`, with the
`≡` symbol read as “is identical to”.

```
0 ≡ (λsz.z)
```

Building from `0`, let’s enumerate the first three counting numbers:

```
1 ≡ (λsz.s(z))
2 ≡ (λsz.s(s(z)))
3 ≡ (λsz.s(s(s(z))))
```

### Successor

The successor of a whole number is defined as the next whole number,
counting up, so the successor of `0` is `1`. The definition of the
successor function is:

```
S ≡ (λxyz.y(xyz))
```

Let’s try that to `0` (in the examples below, the `=` symbol is read
as “is reduced to”):

```
S0
≡ (λxyz.y(xyz))(λsz.z)
= (λyz.y((λsz.z)yz))
= (λyz.y((λz.z)z))
= (λyz.y(z))
≡ 1
```

Let’s break it down:

1. Determine the successor (S) of zero (0).
2. Spell out the equivalent functional notation.
3. Apply `(λsz.z)` to `y` substituting the bound variable `s` to
   `y`.
4. Apply `(λz.z)` to `z` substituting the bound variable `z` to
   `z`.
5. Evaluation stops, and `(λyz.y(z))` is returned, which is the
   number 1.

### Addition

What if you wanted to perform `2+3`? Fortunately, the
successor function will do that for you. You express that as `2S3`,
where you replace `+` as the infix operator. The addition function is
defined as:

```
Name: A
Profile: S ≡ (λxyz.y(xyz))
Inputs: x, y
Outputs: c
Usage: xAy
```

Let’s test it out:

```
2+3 ≡ 2A3
≡ (λsz.s(sz))(λxyz.y(xyz))(λuv.u(u(uv)))
= SS3
≡ (λxyz.y(xyz))((λxyz.y(xyz))(λuv.u(u(uv))))
= (λxyz.y(xyz))(λyz.y((λuv.u(u(uv)))yz))
= (λxyz.y(xyz))(λyz.y(y(y(yz))))
≡ S4
= (λyz.y((λyz.y(y(y(yz))))yz))
= (λyz.y(y(y(y(yz)))))
≡ 5
```

Let’s break it down:

0. State the problem.
1. Spell out the equivalent functional notations for `2`, `S`,
   and `3`.
2. Reducing it gives you `SS3`
3. The full version of `SS3`, which corresponds with `2S3` or
   two `S` and a `3`.
4. Reduce it further.
5. Reduce even further.
6. It is now reduced to `S4`.
7. Apply `S` to `4`.
8. You now arrive at `5`.

### Multiplication

The multiplication function is defined as:

```
Name: M
Profile: (λxyz.x(yz))
Inputs: a, b
Outputs: c
Usage: Mab
```

Unlike with addition which uses infix syntax, multiplying two numbers
follow a prefix syntax. So, to multiply `2` and `3`, you say
`M23`.

Let’s test that out:

```
2*3 ≡ M23
≡ (λabc.a(bc))(λsz.s(sz))(λxy.x(x(xy)))
= (λc.(λsz.s(sz))((λxy.x(x(xy)))c)
= (λcz.((λxy.x(x(xy)))c)(((λxy.x(x(xy)))c)z))
= (λcz.(λy.c(c(cy))))(c(c(cz)))
= (λcz.c(c(c(c(c(cz))))))
≡ 6
```

Multiplying numbers in lambda calculus is pretty simple and
straightforward. But, before you continue to more arithmetic functions,
let’s tackle first truth values and conditionals, which is a
prerequisite in learning the other functions.


## Truth, falsity, and friends

### Booleans

The representations of true and false in lambda calculus, are succinct
and elegant:

```
T ≡ (λxy.x)
F ≡ (λxy.y)
```

In action:

```
Tab ≡ (λxy.x)ab = a
Fab ≡ (λxy.y)ab = b
```

### Logical operations

The three basic operators, And, Or, and Not:

```
∧ ≡ λxy.xy(λuv.v) ≡ λxy.xyF
∨ ≡ λxy.x(λuv.u)y ≡ λxy.xTy
¬ ≡ λx.x(λuv.v)(λab.a) ≡ λx.xFT
```

Let’s see if `¬T` is indeed `F`:

```
¬T
≡ λx.x(λuv.v)(λab.a)(λcd.c)
≡ TFT
≡ (λcd.c)(λuv.v)(λab.a)
= (λuv.v)
≡ F
```


## Let’s count, backwards!

### Predecessor

The predecessor of a number is defined as the preceding number
determined when counting backwards. The reason why the discussion on
the predecessor function is being done separately is that it isn’t
intuitively easy to determine at first, and that knowledge about other
functions is important in understanding it.

Let’s say you have a pair, something like (y, x), wherein the first
element is one step above, or the successor the second element. Since
the first element is the successor, that means the second element is
the predecessor. Visually:

```
(z+1, z) = (z, z-1)
```

Therefore,

```
x = Py iff y = Sx
```

That is, `x` is the predecessor of `y`, if and only if, `y` is
the successor of `x`.

So, to determine the predecessor of a number `x`, you create a pair
like above, then select the second element.

Let’s define some basic units. A pair looks like:

```
(λz.zab)
```

And the smallest unit of pair is:

```
(λz.z00) ≡ (λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z))
```

To select the first and second elements of a pair, you use `T` and
`F`:

```
(λz.zab)(λxy.x) ≡ (λz.zab)T = Tab = a
(λz.zab)(λxy.y) ≡ (λz.zab)F = Fab = b
```

You need a function that takes a pair, then creates a new pair, wherein
the first element is the successor of the second element.

```
Name: Q
Profile: (λpz.z(S(pT))(pT))
Inputs: (a, b)
Outputs: (S(a), b)
Usage: Q(a,b)
```

Let’s test that out:

```
Q(λz.z00)
≡ (λpz.z(S(pT))(pT))(λz.z00)
= (λpz.z(S(pT))(pT))(λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z))
= (λz.z(λsz.s(z)(λsz.z)))
≡ (λz.z10)
```

Looks correct. You can now build your predecessor function:

```
Name: P
Profile: (λn.nQ(λz.z00))F
Inputs: N, where N is a natural number
Outputs: N-1
Usage: PN
```

Let’s test that out:

```
P1
≡ ((λn.nQ(λz.z00))F)1
≡ ((λn.nQ(λz.z00))F)(λsz.s(z))
= (1Q(λz.z00))F
= ((λsz.s(z)((λpz.z((S(pT))(pT)))(λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z)))))(λxy.y)
= (λz.((λpz.z((S(pT))(pT)))(λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z)))z)(λxy.y)
≡ (λu.((λpz.z((S(pT))(pT)))(λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z)))u)(λxy.y)
= ((λpz.z((S(pT))(pT)))(λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z)))(λxy.y)
= (λz.z((S((λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z))T)((λz.z(λsz.z)(λsz.z))T))))(λxy.y)
= (λz.z((S(λsz.z)(λsz.z))))(λxy.y)
= (λz.z((λsz.s(z)(λsz.z))))(λxy.y)
= (λxy.y)((λsz.s(z)(λsz.z)))
= (λsz.z)
≡ 0
```

### Subtraction

Now that you have the predecessor function, you can build your
subtraction function.

```
B ≡ (λxy.yPx)
```

Let’s test that out:

```
B11
≡ (λxy.yPx) (λsz.s(z)) (λsz.s(z))
= (λsz.s(z)) (P(λsz.s(z)))
= (λsz.s(z)) (λsz.z)
= (λz.(λsz.z)z)
= (λz.(λz.z))
≡ (λsz.z)
≡ 0
```


## Conclusion

You’ve just scratched the surface of lambda calculus, but you have
just witnessed its immense expressive power, considering how minimal
the system is defined. In our next article, we’ll demystify even more
lambda calculus magic. Stay tuned!
