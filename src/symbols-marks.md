Symbols and Marks
=================

This short guide gives you a tour on how to use the hidden symbols on
your keyboard, that are better suited to perform symbol duties than
their ill cousins from the typewriter era—the (-), (') and (")
symbols.

Each section begins with an input sequence for Windows, Mac, and Linux
(X) systems, respectively. The `+` symbol signifies that you press the
key to its left, before you press the key to its right. That is, to
input `Option + Shift + -`, you must press and hold <kbd>Option</kbd>,
then press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>, then press <kbd>-</kbd>. For the
Linux input sequences, the keys should be pressed and released. That
is, to input `Compose - - -`, you must press and release
<kbd>Compose</kbd>, press and release <kbd>-</kbd>, press and release
another <kbd>-</kbd>, and press and release the last
<kbd>-</kbd>. Also for Linux, the Compose (Multi_key) must first be
set in your .Xmodmap file, or in your Desktop Environment (DE)
configuration.


Hyphens (-)
-----------

* Windows: -
* Mac: -
* Linux: -

First, the hyphen on your keyboard is not part of the dash family. It
looks like one, but it isn’t one. It is used to join words, and to
separate syllables of a single word. For example, to speak of a bird
that eats snakes, we type:

* A snake-eating bird.

To speak of a snake that eats birds, we say:

* A snake eating bird.


En dashes (–)
-------------

* Windows: Alt + 0150
* Mac: Option + -
* Linux: Compose - - space

The en dash is used to denote a range of values. To express the date
range from 1960 to 2016, we type:

* 1960–2016

Another use of an en dash is to express a contrast or connection
between words:

* Mother–daughter relationship
* San Juan–San Fernando leg


Em dashes (—)
-------------

* Windows: Alt + 0151
* Mac: Option + Shift + -
* Linux: Compose - - -

The em dash can be used in a multitude of ways. To use it like a
colon:

* Two men are dead: Juan and Pedro.
* Two men are dead—Juan and Pedro.

To use it like a reverse colon:

* These are its qualities: soft, slimy, and spiky.
* Soft, slimy, and spiky—these are its qualities.

To use it like parentheses:

* Two men (Juan and Pedro) are dead.
* Two men—Juan and Pedro—are dead.

To denote interruption of the speaker:

* “I think I will go and—hell, no.”


Left and right double quotes (“) (”)
------------------------------------

Left double quote (“)
* Windows: Alt + 0147
* Mac: Option + [
* Linux: Compose 6 "

Right double quote (”)
* Windows: Alt + 0148
* Mac: Option + Shift + [
* Linux: Compose 9 "

Double quotes are used to denote words that were spoken by a speaker.

* She came up to me and said, “Can we determine its probability?”

It is also used when writing quotes (attributions):

* “Supposing is good, but finding out is better.” ―Samuel Clemens


Left and right single quotes (‘) (’)
------------------------------------

Left single quote (‘)
* Windows: Alt + 0145
* Mac: Option + ]
* Linux: Compose 6 '

Right single quote (’)
* Alt + 0146
* Mac: Option + Shift + ]
* Linux: Compose 9 '

Single quotes are used when a speech is embedded within another speech:

* He muttered to himself, “I thought he said ‘It is not doable’ when we talked yesterday.”

The right single quote is also used when denoting possessions,
contractions, and abbreviations:

* These are Juan’s scalpels.
* Dance like ’tis ’60.


Prime and double prime (′) (″)
------------------------------

Prime (′)
* Windows: Alt + 8242
* Mac: Option + 2032
* Linux: Compose * . '

Double prime (″)
* Windows: Alt + 8243
* Mac: Option + 2033
* Linux: Compose * . "

The quotation symbols on your keyboard (') and (") look like prime symbols but they aren’t—they’re sloppy vestiges from typewriters. The correct glyphs are (′) and (″). The prime symbol (′) is used to denote feet, minutes, and arcminutes, while the double prime symbol (″) is used to denote inches, seconds, and arcseconds. To express a height of six feet and two inches, we type:

* 6′2″

The express five degrees, four arcminutes, and three arcseconds, we
type:

* 5°4′3″

The double prime symbol can also be used as the ditto mark. The ditto
mark is used to indicate that words above it are to be repeated. For
example:

* Red herons, cranes, and mantises.
* Pink ″           ″            ″       ″
