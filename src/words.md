* While the intrepid ones are braving the storms with courage and
  triumph, the cowards are basking in the shores of submission and
  conformity.<br>


* Curiosity is the enemy of ignorance, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.<br>


* Golden opportunities are often missed because they are cloaked with
  dirty garment, rather than with glitter and gold. Lethargy is as
  nefarious as haste.<br>


* When you don't give your best, and unfavorable results come out,
  you'll wonder what would have happened had you done your finest. If,
  however, you gave your ace, then serene tranquility will fill the
  void, and not a single sliver of doubt will permeate your soul.<br>


* The most wonderful sensations in the life of our cognizant
  consciousnesses are wrought with traps, perils, and pitfalls. But
  only those who are willing to embark on these treacherous journeys
  will have the fortune to apprise the tales.<br>


* Live. Die. Live again.<br>


* One of the most atrocious crimes a sensibility can ever commit to
  its host is compulsion of negligence to fulfill the functions of
  meeting its bliss.<br>

* The aggregate heft of the comprehensions on a choice that we have
  made, does not lie within the boundaries of what it is; it is the
  firm grasp of the elucidating vindications why we have made that
  choice, that will liberate, and free us.<br>


* With the relentless promise of my facetious preoccupations, lest
  mindful capture, I compel myself to the unphased subjugations over
  the thin vinyl of the aqueous walls which coat my presumptions, and
  vindictive beliefs. For the horses of death shall thump, and shake
  the ground, as they tremble the very earth that clamps this peaceful
  chaos together. I have, and will always, wield my own slice of
  eternity, for I shall banish, and disintegrate, but permeate the
  very soul of these livid disenchantments.<br>


* It doesn't really matter if we keep failing; what matters is that we
  keep trying.<br>


* Unless we will have the boldness and audacity to drive them away,
  our greatest fears will not leave us.  If, however, they are there
  to stay, then we should have the strength and courage to tame them.<br>


* If your ship doesn't come to you, swim to it; if you can't swim,
  have the ship towed to you.<br>


* The less you worry, the happier you'll be.<br>


* Smile, even in the face of adversary, for that will also be the time
  that you'll embrace victory.<br>


* If we want to create the future, focus on the moment rather than the
  outcome.<br>


* To obtain a direction, you must first aim.<br>


* Answers, no matter how confident you are with them, are incorrect,
  if they were for the wrong questions.<br>


* Fear births doubt.<br>


* Procrastinate procrastination.<br>


* Defer to use what you will use to defer.<br>


* Don't find an excuse not to do it. Instead, find an excuse to do it.<br>
