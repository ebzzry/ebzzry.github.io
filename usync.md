An Introduction to Usync
======================================================================

<center>2013-05-21 19:18:33</center>

Usync is a a site-to-site synchronization tool written in
[Scsh](http://www.scsh.net). It makes use of
[Unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/), and
[rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/), for bi- and uni-directional
synchronizations, respectively.

## Introduction

Site-to-site synchronizations are usually needed, when two locations,
which are called sites, in this article, make file updates
independently. Let's say the company _Foo_ has two offices. In the
first office, they have the accounting, and logistics departments. In
the second office, they have the IT, and HR departments. Both have a
common `/pub` tree, that has subdirectories assigned to each
department. Without synchronization, when the first office needs
information from the second office, they'd have to pull the updates,
manually. With synchronization, the first office can access the files
from the second office, as if the IT and HR departments, were in the
first office. Usync helps to achieve this.


## Basic Usage

To perform two-way synchronization of the directory `/pub/yot/ninam`,
between the current host, to the hosts `tarupam`, and `taubetmo`,
while preserving the directory structure remotely (take note, that
there must be no spaces between the hosts specification, due to the
`IFS` environment variable, found in most shells):

```bash
$ usync /pub/yot/ninam/ tarupam,taubetmo
```

The command above will perform two-way synchronization of the diretory
`ninam/` found under `/pub/yot/`, to `tarupam:/pub/yot/`, and
`taubetmo:/pub/yot/`.

Using our example above, the two-way synchronization system basically
tells that if the tree `tarupam:/pub/yot/ninam/` contains new and/or
updated items, compared with `localhost:/pub/yot/ninam/`, and
`localhost:/pub/yot/ninam/` also happens to have new and/or updated
items, then, they will trade updates.

Ideally, the result is that `localhost:/pub/yot/ninam/`,
`tarupam:/pub/yot/ninam/`, and `taubetmo:/pub/yot/ninam/`, are all
equal.


## Semi-advanced Usage

It is also possible to perform synchronization of multiple files, and
directories, to remote hosts. To do so, run:

```bash
$ usync /pub/yot/ninam/ ~/file.text ~reyn/*.blend tarupam,taubetmo
```

The command above will perform two-way synchronization of the paths
`/pub/yot/ninam/`, `~/file.text`, and `~reyn/*.blend` to the
remote hosts `tarupam`, and `taubetmo`, using the same directory
structuring system described above.

If you want to perform one-way synchronization, of the above, like
_rsync_, run:

```bash
$ usync --one-way --prefer-local /pub/yot/ninam/ \
~/file.text ~reyn/draft.blend tarupam,taubetmo
```

For more usage information, run:

```bash
$ usync --help
```
