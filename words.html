Lethargy is as  nefarious as haste.<br></li></ul><ul><li>When you don't give your best, and unfavorable results come out,  you'll wonder what would have happened had you done your finest. If,  however, you gave your ace, then serene tranquility will fill the  void, and not a single sliver of doubt will permeate your soul.<br></li></ul><ul><li>The most wonderful sensations in the life of our cognizant  consciousnesses are wrought with traps, perils, and pitfalls. But  only those who are willing to embark on these treacherous journeys  will have the fortune to apprise the tales.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Live. Die.

For the horses of death shall thump, and shake  the ground, as they tremble the very earth that clamps this peaceful  chaos together. I have, and will always, wield my own slice of  eternity, for I shall banish, and disintegrate, but permeate the  very soul of these livid disenchantments.<br></li></ul><ul><li>It doesn't really matter if we keep failing; what matters is that we  keep trying.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Unless we will have the boldness and audacity to drive them away,  our greatest fears will not leave us.  If, however, they are there  to stay, then we should have the strength and courage to tame them.<br></li></ul><ul><li>If your ship doesn't come to you, swim to it; if you can't swim,  have the ship towed to you.<br></li></ul><ul><li>The less you worry, the happier you'll be.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Smile, even in the face of adversary, for that will also be the time  that you'll embrace victory.<br></li></ul><ul><li>If we want to create the future, focus on the moment rather than the  outcome.<br></li></ul><ul><li>To obtain a direction, you must first aim.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Answers, no matter how confident you are with them, are incorrect,  if they were for the wrong questions.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Fear births doubt.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Procrastinate procrastination.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Defer to use what you will use to defer.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Don't find an excuse not to do it.
